<p>Abigail's steps were silent as she crept around the corners of the familiar hallways, desperately trying to ignore the statues that would turn and stare at her.</p>
<p>Duke didn't creep.</p>
<p>He strode, proud and sure in the knowledge that once observed, the past could not be changed.</p>
<p>They were just ghosts in the fog.</p>
<p>Cloudwalkers moving through memories.</p>
<p>Abigail struggled with that concept when everyone could see and interact with her.</p>
<p>They reached Duke's cold and dark office, with its door of living oak, and he banged loudly on it.</p>
<p>The door swung open, and Abigail winced as she saw Duke looking at Duke.</p>
<p>The one behind the desk laughed, "Truly? You needed to return to me? What piece of knowledge have we forgotten?"</p>
<p>The Duke that had come with her shrugged, "What does it matter what I say, you will not recall it."</p>
<p>The Duke behind the table stood, his hands slamming down onto the table, but as they did they become a moving torrent of black liquid, moving towards them.</p>
<p>Duke slammed the door closed, and spun to Abigail, "Run!"</p>
<p>She found more magic in his statement than mere command, and found herself halfway down the hall before she could ask why.</p>
<p>The young nymph streaked down the hallways, wishing she had some level of control of her magic.</p>
<p>What use was she?</p>
<p>A stone hand jerked her to a stop, and Abigail spun.</p>
<p>The face of a statue stared into her, black liquid pouring from an empty visor.</p>
<p>Abigail cursed and tried to jerk away, but it was pathetic.</p>
<p>In instinct she reached out for Vitamancy, but felt nothing.</p>
<p>Her magic was gone.</p>
<p>Abigail clenched her fists, "What do you want with me?"</p>
<p>The possessed statue fell to its knees bowing till its head touched the ground.</p>
<p>Abigail winced, "Say what?"</p>
<p>It looked up at her and spoke.</p>
<p>The walls shook, stone fell from the ceilings, and Abigail felt herself fill with the uncontrolled magic she was beginning to grasp.</p>
<p>She felt her hair whip into a frenzy around her face, saw it streak to white in a moment.</p>
<p>"We are honored to be in your presence."</p>
<p>Abigail sighed, and then heard something like metal strike the floor beside her, and she was winced as she saw the scythe in her hand.</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>The statue trembled in fear, "We are the forgotten, the ones you cursed to wander the unchangeable memories of the past."</p>
<p>Abigail frowned, "And you decided to attack passersby by yourself, did you?"</p>
<p>The statue crumpled, forming a ball, as the voice reduced to a whisper, "We were lost. We thought your rage would never end."</p>
<p>Abigail crouched, "I've go news for you, dude. I am not Death."</p>
<p>The statue unfurled slowly, "You are... I remember your face..."</p>
<p>It paused, a trembling stone hand brushing her cheek, "Yet... It was set hard with years of rage and destruction... It has been softened by happiness and... Love?"</p>
<p>Abigail's heart jumped a beat as Kyle's face loomed in her mind. She smiled sweetly and took the stone hand, "What crime did you commit?"</p>
<p>The statue laughed, "We dared to offer you our soul in exchange for power... We did not offer it to you direct... A member of your court."</p>
<p>Abigail frowned, "And they would be?"</p>
<p>"War, Wrath, Sin, and Judgement." The statue stared at her, "Have you forgotten all? Become a nymph to understand your enemy?"</p>
<p>Abigail shrugged, "I nearly died... Ever since, I have had this magic... Usually in the presence of... Well, I was kinda taught to call you... Abominations."</p>
<p>The statue laughed as it stood, "The Lady of the Dark, the Queen of the Dead, reduced to a little nymph... Lost in a land of those who hate her..."</p>
<p>Abigail spun the scythe, feeling the air tear apart, her vision sharpening, and she clenched a fist, "If you want a fight, you have one."</p>
<p>The creature backed away, bowing low, "Sorry, little nymph... There are many more of us... Than you and your little scythe."</p>
<p>She winced as the walls began to bleed, a thick black liquid creeping down, and Abigail knew she had picked the wrong fight.</p>
<p>She felt the scythe in her hand, the power it held.</p>
<p>She felt the air moving around her in a torrent, looking at her white hair being tossed about.</p>
<p>So be it.</p>
<p>If they called her Death, so she would be, and her hand would strike down like the hammer of the old gods.</p>
<p>Abigail embraced the rage, feeling her scales flickering in the air, seeing them change from a light blue to the blackest night.</p>
<p>She glared around, her scythe feeling like an extension of herself, and she felt her throat begin to vibrate.</p>
<p>She spoke, her voice echoing, the hidden strength in it threatening to tear the building apart, "For crimes against your Queen, I sentence you to the Void."</p>
<p>Abigail shrugged, "Come get your relief."</p>
<hr />
<p><img alt="Necromancy" src="http://necromancersapprentice.shaknaisrael.com/img/Symbol_Necromancy.svg" /></p>
<p>Duke was thrown against a wall, black tentacles encircling each of his roots, and he stared down at a bastardised form of himself.</p>
<p>The creature laughed, "How did you do it, Adrian? Convince the Black Queen to forgive your debt?"</p>
<p>Duke winced, "So she truly is the Lady?"</p>
<p>The shadow shrugged, "We believe so... Not that it will matter."</p>
<p>It picked up a book from a nearby table, "A fascinating read, professor. It is the reason we decided to stay here. Guard it's secrets."</p>
<p>Duke clenched his fists, struggling to find any purchase on magic.</p>
<p>The shadow shrugged, "But then... We would know it's power, wouldn't we? We are the Merose, after all."</p>
<p>Duke winced, "I don't want to control the Merose."</p>
<p>The shadow inside his past shrugged, "No, you want to control the one who cursed us. Put us here... But we don't want that. She has offered us respite. Oblivion... For that... We welcome her."</p>
<p>Duke felt a chill run down his back, what had he done?</p>
<p>Bringing Abigail here had been a mistake.</p>
<p>There was a flash of fire, and Duke collapsed coughing to the ground.</p>
<p>He looked up, pausing as he saw Kyle.</p>
<p>His body was battered, his hair was singed. His clothes were little more than rags, but it was the young man's eyes that were the most telling.</p>
<p>They were red, puffy, and empty.</p>
<p>Duke winced, "Kyle?"</p>
<p>The young man clenched a fist and Duke was flung through the wall behind him.</p>
<p>He groaned, glancing up as Kyle walked over the rubble, "I told you to protect her, Duke. I will not lose her as well."</p>
<p>Duke cringed, "Fiona's dead?"</p>
<p>Kyle stumbled, nearly collapsing, unable to speak, tears running down his cheeks. He nodded almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p>Duke stood up, "How... You could bring her back."</p>
<p>Kyle shook his head, "No... No I can't. She doesn't want to be brought back... She cursed her kingdom. All members of the Pact, dwarves and... Traitors... Can no longer set foot there."</p>
<p>Duke winced, "And you are a traitor to the Other Side."</p>
<p>Kyle nodded, and Duke shrugged, "Then break her spell."</p>
<p>The young man glared, "You think I haven't tried? She made a aimimantic spell of eight verses, using dual reflection. I only know of one stronger, and it was used to make the gateway to the Other Side in the Shades!"</p>
<p>Duke winced, "I am so sorry, Kyle."</p>
<p>The young man turned, "Let's go get Abigail."</p>
<p>"She's not the one in danger, Kyle... The Merose thought she was the Lady, and that seals it for me. She is."</p>
<p>Kyle shook his head, and then vanished.</p>
<p>Duke sighed heavily.</p>
<p>He'd tried to teach Kyle, but now... He pitied the living.</p>
<hr />
<p><img alt="Messormancy" src="http://necromancersapprentice.shaknaisrael.com/img/Symbol_Messormancy.svg" /></p>
<p>Abigail slammed the butt of her scythe into the ground and the black liquid attempting to wash over her was shoved away, and she was left in a bubble of air, as the liquid lay frozen, washing above her in a frozen wave.</p>
<p>She felt something dark rising up in her, and she was tempted to obliterate it all, right now, in the moment.</p>
<p>Destroy them all.</p>
<p>It would be easy.</p>
<p>"Neat trick, care to teach me it?"</p>
<p>Abigail's hair dropped as the wind vanished, the scythe evaporated in her hand.</p>
<p>She turned and stared at Kyle through a frizzy mass of hair and instantly blushed, "Hey."</p>
<p>He shook his head, and she saw the sadness.</p>
<p>She held out her hand, "Show me."</p>
<p>Kyle shook his head, "Not like this... Not right now."</p>
<p>Her voice echoed with power as she shouted, "Show me!"</p>
<p>Kyle stumbled, and winced, "What in the Shades is happening to you, Abigail?"</p>
<p>She collapsed onto her knees, clutching her head, gently rocking. "It's all wrong, it's all wrong."</p>
<p>Kyle crouched in front of her, "Then let's go home."</p>
<p>She didn't get a chance to argue.</p>
<p>They were simply back in the ruins, no more freaky black liquid attacking her, no more memories of war. No more soul of evil.</p>
<p>Abigail stared at the ground, "You must hate me, Kyle."</p>
<p>She heard him make a sound of astonishment, and she shrugged, "If it wasn't for me, you'd be with Fi, and she'd be safe."</p>
<p>Kyle sighed heavily, "Fi... Fi went so that everyone else would have a chance. I couldn't stop her, I could barely help defend her."</p>
<p>Abigail felt tears rolling down her face, her scales fading back to blue, and she shrugged, "If I wasn't in the way, you could have saved her... Back when this all started... It all would have been better if you never met me."</p>
<p>Kyle stared at her in shock, and Abigail looked down at the ground, guilt overwhelming her.</p>
<p>It was all her fault.</p>
<p>A calloused hand touched her cheek softly, and she looked up in surprise, tears running down her face, and she saw him smile at her, through the grief and stains of war.</p>
<p>He leaned in, his forehead touching hers, as she felt his emotions begin to flood over her.</p>
<p>Regret.</p>
<p>Isaac Isaac stood there, roaring, an enormous sword in his hand as he cut a swathe through his enemies.</p>
<p>The troll king stood, sword in hand, as the sun crept over the horizon.</p>
<p>He screamed in rage as his body turned to stone.</p>
<p>As the statue became complete, hammers struck hard, and he crumbled to dust.</p>
<p>Exhaustion.</p>
<p>Kyle flew above the world, rings of fire, stone and wind striking the ground.</p>
<p>A shield surrounded a nearby boulder, bound with Aimimancy, sucking him dry.</p>
<p>His grip on the magic keeping him in the air faltered, and he very nearly fell to his own death, barely clawing back on some hidden reserve of energy.</p>
<p>Hatred.</p>
<p>A dwarf laughed loudly, his hammer channeling lightning as he struck down those around him.</p>
<p>"About time we made the elves extinct, isn't it boys?"</p>
<p>Grief.</p>
<p>The boulder cracked open, a burst of blood shot into the air, and Kyle gasped as he felt the Aimimancy snapping into place, changing the world.</p>
<p>He had a fleeting glance of the disfigured pulp of bone and blood, that had once been Fiona.</p>
<p>Then he was gone.</p>
<p>Tears ran down Abigail's face as she breathed in Kyle's scent, and then a calloused hand took her chin gently between two fingers and raised her head.</p>
<p>Butterflies filled her stomach, as she stared into his eyes.</p>
<p>Confusion filled her head, her emotions were all over the place, and she didn't dare to trust her own muddled thoughts.</p>
<p>She didn't have to.</p>
<p>Her lips met his, as all around her danced the memories of Kyle's past.</p>
<p>Armies rose and died, as he held her in his arms.</p>
<hr />
<p><img alt="Ventusamancy" src="http://necromancersapprentice.shaknaisrael.com/img/Symbol_Ventusamancy.svg" /></p>
<p>Draco looked over as a wall was shattered to pieces, a dozen stone soldiers looking directly at him, and he frowned, "The heir of the College has already been found... What do you want with me?"</p>
<p>"Fiona Applesilver is dead." A voice reverberated through his soul, and his eyes widened, fear itching up his spine.</p>
<p>Draco stared at them, "And so you have chosen me?"</p>
<p>The statue inclined his head slightly, and Draco grimaced, "Bar the gates. Rebuild the walls. The College is to prepare for war."</p>
<p>He spun around, pausing as he saw a young man, his eyes bloodshot, standing behind him.</p>
<p>"What war?"</p>
<p>Bellum winced, "You lost against the Pact. If you lost Fiona... They won."</p>
<p>Kyle smiled grimly, "She banished us. The Elven kingdom is a stronghold against the dangers of this world, now."</p>
<p>Bellum winced, "So the Pact will come here next. We need to prepare."</p>
<p>Kyle clenched a fist, and Draco screamed as he felt the blood.in his veins boil. He stared up at what had once been nothing more than a young student.</p>
<p>Kyle stood over him, "There is so... Little... Stopping me sending you back to the Other Side... Did you know what?"</p>
<p>Draco forced himself to his feet, relying on the fabled strength of his ancestors, "I will stop you, if necessary, Master Kilroy."</p>
<p>Kyle rolled his eyes, and the pain vanished. "We're not on equal ground, Headmaster... We were once... But it was a brief moment when a show of power could intimidate a young boy."</p>
<p>Draco smiled weakly, "Seems you learned that lesson well."</p>
<p>Kyle shrugged, "I don't want you to prepare for war, Headmaster. War means you get to fight back. Drive an enemy out into the open and cut them down."</p>
<p>Draco frowned, "The College is being restored, Kyle. Careful about commanding its Headmaster."</p>
<p>Kyle smiled softly, "I want you to defend something for me, Headmaster... If you fail... I will not fail to end this world."</p>
<p>Draco felt a chill run down his spine, "Miss Ignis."</p>
<p>Kyle nodded, "You'll find her... Difficult... But I need to end what I have started. If that means I go alone and buy everyone some more time... So be it."</p>
<p>Draco winced, "You plan on taking the Shades by yourself?"</p>
<p>Kyle shrugged, "What choice do I have? Fiona is dead. Isaac Isaac is dead. Balta, Malata and New Rome are still infighting about who their next generals should be, and if they truly are bound to the Draco Charter."</p>
<p>Draco.winced, "There are seven other magical establishments in this world. Seek help from them."</p>
<p>Kyle shook his head, "They are the only reason you and I can still talk. After the Silvergate clan were butchered, they were the ones who rushed to protect the border... And others are busy with the Bloodbound Pact... I don't see any other solutions, Draco."</p>
<p>The Headmaster shook his head slowly, "You are still just a student of Necromancy, Kyle. How do you expect to fight the creators of it?"</p>
<p>He grinned, "They don't use Necromancy, Headmaster. They use Messormancy, channeled from its source, the Lady Death."</p>
<p>Draco winced, "Don't say her name."</p>
<p>Kyle shrugged, "What of it? I've seen her face, Draco."</p>
<p>The half-dragon took a step backwards, "I always wished that she and her court were just fairy tales."</p>
<p>Kyle shrugged, "Unfortunately, they're the ones trying to kill half this world, and keep it so. The living should never be allowed to outnumber the dead."</p>
<p>Draco shook his head, "The Lady is the source of almost all magic... How can we survive this? How can you imagine that you could fight her?"</p>
<p>Kyle laughed, "I've already dealt my hand. Time will tell if I can get through this... Just... Keep Abigail safe. Without her, I won't need to destroy the world."</p>
<p>Draco nodded gravely, "Fine. Where is she?"</p>
<p>Kyle laughed and vanished.</p>
<p>Draco turned around and couldn't help staring.</p>
<p>The nymph was standing nearby, one hand on a broken wall, staring at the horizon.</p>
<p>Her scales were visible, her glamour gone. They were black, the edges tinged with red.</p>
<p>Her hair was black, with streaks of white, including her fringe.</p>
<p>But what truly made him fear, was the scythe sitting in her other hand.</p>
<p>She sighed heavily, "Tell me, Headmaster, have you ever met a Reaper?"</p>
<p>He winced, "No, they have no business with the living."</p>
<p>She turned around, her eyes glowing, a brilliant blue. "I am not a Reaper. I reap those who reap the dead."</p>
<p>Draco shivered, and then another figure entered the room slowly, an Elven man, and he smiled softly, "And I will reap for you again."</p>

<p>Candice froze as the world around her grew dark. She muttered a spell, holding a fireball at the ready.</p>
<p>Laughter echoed around her.</p>
<p>She felt her anger, coaxing it, growing it to overcome the terror burning through her.</p>
<p>She ground her teeth, waiting impatiently.</p>
<p>But they liked to play with their food.</p>
<p>Make it scream and run, and just as you thought you might be able to escape, they'd swoop in and tear out your heart.</p>
<p>A swarm of flies appeared nearby, reassembling into a man. He smiled grimly, never glancing towards her. He clenched a fist, and then spoke, "Annoying, aren't they, Candice? Taunting when they know they can't touch you."</p>
<p>She glared over at him, "Oh really, Kyle? And why would that be? Because you're my night in shining armor?"</p>
<p>Kyle laughed, "Because of the Draco Charter. Every vampire in this world is bound by it, and the Lady has ratified it."</p>
<p>The swarm vanished, and they were left standing on snowy planes, alone.</p>
<p>Kyle turned towards her, "What are you doing out here?"</p>
<p>She.sneered, "I'm a Silvergate, Kyle. I won't ignore them anymore, even if you are."</p>
<p>He sighed heavily, weariness rolling off him like a waterfall, "Candice... You're the last of your bloodline. Fiona died defending the Elvish Kingdom from the Bloodbound Pact."</p>
<p>She frowned, processing it slowly, "The Bloodbound want you gone."</p>
<p>Kyle shrugged, "They be about to get their wish."</p>
<p>Candice blinked, "You're headed to the Shades."</p>
<p>He nodded grimly, and she glanced around, "You and what army?"</p>
<p>Kyle laughed, "I left my army at the College of History and Magic. I'm hoping that enough remnants of the other colleges still exist by the time I get to the Shades."</p>
<p>Candice sneered, "You travelled to the Elven Kingdom quick enough. Why not do that again? Why are you here?"</p>
<p>Kyle shook his head, "You know the secret of the Shades, Candice... You know the Gateway there. I can't pet them know I'm coming... If I do, then they will be ready for me."</p>
<p>She shivered, despite herself, "I've only seen the Gateway once, at my initiation... There's no way you could hope to get close. It's not guarded by hungry vampires, it has its own army. We call them -"</p>
<p>"- Reapers." Kyle finished, and nodded, "I know... Did you hear what Abigail did before you left?"</p>
<p>Candice stared, "You really think she managed to cure a Reaper?"</p>
<p>Kyle shook his head, "No... She just gave him back his free will. He's guarding her now."</p>
<p>Candice scratched her head, "You have a Reaper, and a Reaper-killer on your side. Why in the Shades are you leaving them behind?"</p>
<p>"You can't fight the Lady, Candice." Kyle sighed, shaking his head, "No matter what you do... She comes for you in the end... I'm not going to fight them. I'm just going to stop them."</p>
<p>Candice felt her fury hit tipping point and the fireball launched towards him, growing to the size of a house before it hit him.</p>
<p>The fireball seemed to crash over him, and then it righted.</p>
<p>Kyle stood there, engulfed, "Tell me, young Silvergate, is it only anger that can fuel Pyromancy?"</p>
<p>She swallowed nervously, remembering her attacks on Fiona, "Hatred works just as well."</p>
<p>The flames vanished and Kyle sighed, "How about hating yourself?"</p>
<p>She paused, surprised, "I... Wouldn't know."</p>
<p>Kyle smiled, his eyes not quite touching it, "No. You wouldn't. But you do know the Shades, and if I need to sneak up on anyone, it would need to be a Silvergate to guide me."</p>
<p>Candice paused, "Instead of taking on the Shades by yourself... You want me to help you out?"</p>
<p>Kyle shrugged, "I've had worse ideas."</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes, "Not by much... Come on, it'll take a week and a half.to get there."</p>
<p>Kyle rolled his eyes, "I wasn't walking there."</p>
<p>Candice frowned, "Then how? No magic, remember?"</p>
<p>Kyle shook his head, "No big or loud magic... Ever wanted to be able.to fly like a vamp?"</p>

<p>Braun sat down in a chair carefully, letting out a long sigh of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Abigail's hands touched his shoulders, "Getting comfortable are we?"</p>
<p>He shot to his feet, surprised when she laughingly pushed him back into the chair, "Relax, we aren't needed anywhere just yet."</p>
<p>Braun winced, "Sorry... I haven't sat since... I died."</p>
<p>Abigail blinked, "She that much of a bitch?"</p>
<p>Braun shook his head, "It's not that... The dead don't sleep... We have no time to relax."</p>
<p>"But she sits on a big throne, doesn't she?" Abigail asked, injustice ringing in her voice.</p>
<p>Braun shook his head, "We rarely see our Queen... She maintains the Gateway to this realm, gives the Reapers their power,  oversees all of us... She maintains the Other Side, ensuring it doesn't just fall apart."</p>
<p>Abigail frowned, "The Other Side could fall apart?"</p>
<p>Braun smiled sheepishly, "It's artificial. Shouldn't exist. The Lady created it, so that when people died, they shouldn't have to suffer as she did in life."</p>
<p>Abigail rolled her eyes, "Dude. I wasn't brought up on your fairy tales. What suffering?"</p>
<p>Braun shrugged, "Something typical, I guess. Her lover fought in a war and died. Necromancy was impossible. She would never see him again, so she built a place where the dead would go, so that you could be reunited, never.to be separated again."</p>
<p>Abigail scratched her head, "That sounds like a good thing. All sweet and cute... The Other Side is trying to destroy this world."</p>
<p>Braun shook his head, "Not destroy. Absorb. No more death, no more pain. Utopia. At least, that's how War and Disaster try and sell it."</p>
<p>Abigail smiled, "So... The Court of the Lady, they kind of rule in her stead?"</p>
<p>Braun nodded, "Yeah."</p>
<p>Abigail shrugged, "Tell me more. Everything. Who are they? What is the Other Side like?"</p>
<p>Braun smiled softly, "You've never been?"</p>
<p>"I got stuck in Limbo for a week, and I went.to a place like a void... But it was bad." Abigail trailed off.</p>
<p>Braun swallowed, "You went to the Clearing House. It's where.criminals are stripped of their immortality, and left to kill each other."</p>
<p>Abigail winced, "That's just plain nasty."</p>
<p>Braun shrugged, "It's either that or the Reapers eat your soul... And you become one of us."</p>
<p>Abigail scratched her chin, "Are you the first free Reaper?"</p>
<p>Braun shrugged, "Maybe... May the first Reapers were free. Who knows? I'd guess a Reaper once got sent to the Clearing House, and the Lady didn't want to risk it ever again."</p>
<p>Abigail smiled, "I need to see her."</p>
<p>Braun launched himself backwards out of the chair, scythe appearing in hand, "Are you insane?"</p>
<p>Abigail's blue scales faded to black, highlighting her eyes and hair, "Do you think I'm insane?"</p>
<p>Braun winced, "You don't want to walk in there. The only way out, for the living, is by dying. By making a deal with a member of the court, to return."</p>
<p>Abigail laughed, her scales fading back to blue, and then to her white skin, "Kyle made a deal with your Queen to protect me."</p>
<p>Braun scratched his head, "Are you sure? I didn't get the memo."</p>
<p>Abigail winced, "Oh no... Do you think it possible... That someone like War has... Usurped her?"</p>
<p>Braun cringed, "That's not... Possible."</p>
<p>Abigail raised an eyebrow, "Really?"</p>
<p>Braun sighed heavily, "Discord has tried once or twice. But he was helping our Queen. Leading the invasion."</p>
<p>Abigail winced, "So, it's possible. That Death isn't the bad guy here. She might just be a pawn, or figure head."</p>
<p>Braun burst out laughing, "Our Queen? A pawn? She handbuilt another realm! Do you truly think anyone could control her?"</p>
<p>Abigail's face clouded, "You'd be surprised what people would do for the sake of love, family, and their own adulation."</p>
<p>Braun cocked his head, "Speaking from experience?"</p>
<p>She shook her head slowly, but for a moment her glamor collapsed, revealing the nymph beneath.</p>
<p>Braun ran a hand through his hair, and then sighed with relief as another figure entered the room.</p>
<p>The dryad cracked as he shrugged, "So, Abigail, is this creature helpful to us?"</p>
<p>Braun glared at him, "I'm right here, Necromancer."</p>
<p>The dryad glanced at him, "A fact I am painfully aware of, young elf."</p>
<p>Braun paused, "You think you're older than me? Really?"</p>
<p>The dryad laughed, "You trained at the College of Pyromancy, nearly a thousand years ago, you impetuous twerp."</p>
<p>Braun started as memories flooded his mind, but most distinct was an old dryad, who had helped to found the College.</p>
<p>"Professor Ducas?" He asked in shock, and the dryad smiled, "So you remember a few things from your past, at least."</p>
<p>Braun stood up slowly, his scythe appearing in hand, "I remember a man who swore to kill Death and destroy the Other Side. An abomination."</p>
<p>Abigail rolled her eyes, flicking her wrist. Her black scales flew over her in a wave, and his scythe vanished.</p>
<p>He fell forwards in agony, clutching his chest as his magic seemed to tear from his hands.</p>
<p>Abigail glared at the professor, "You really have to provoke him?"</p>
<p>The dryad frowned, "You have developed some skill, Miss Ignis."</p>
<p>She shrugged, "Something to do with a thousand cursed trying to kill me… Did you really swear to kill Death, herself?"</p>
<p>The dryad winced, and Braun glared, "Well?"</p>
<p>"I did…" Duke hesitated, "Until I met her. She took all that away. I'm a different creature now."</p>
<p>Abigail cocked her head, "What do you mean she took that away? What did she change?"</p>
<p>Braun smiled softly, "Oh, I can answer that one. He wanted to kill our Queen because he'd lost someone dear to him, and thought that no one should be sent to the Other Side. Thought it just a prison."</p>
<p>Duke glared at him, "Don't you dare."</p>
<p>Braun rolled his eyes, "You really think she doesn't deserve to know? Know what drove you to Necromancy? The reason you never use it anymore?"</p>
<p>The dryad clenched a fist, "Necromancy is dangerous. It should not be used unless it has to."</p>
<p>"But you used it." Braun sneered, "You used it when you shouldn't have, and our Queen came for you. A price must be paid."</p>
<p>The dryad shook his head, "Please…"</p>
<p>Abigail shrugged, "My best friend just died. I'm not exactly in a caring mood. Duke… What in the Shades happened?"</p>
<p>The professor leaned against a wall, and sighed, "I discovered Necromancy after my mate died. I used it, not knowing that a price must always be paid. And so, the Lady came to me, explained my idiocy… And then she gave me till sundown. After that, she destroyed the soul of my mate… I can never bring her back again… The Black Queen… Destroyed… Her… Soul…"</p>
<p>He trailed off, tears running down his wooden face.</p>
<p>Abigail winced, "That's so… Cold…"</p>
<p>Braun laughed, "That's our Queen all over, Abigail. She is the end of all life, remember?"</p>
<p>Abigail winced, "Then… Why does everyone keep telling me I'm her? I care… I love, I hurt, I feel betrayal… How can… I be Death?"</p>
<p>Braun looked at her, "You are not our Queen, and I'd really rather you didn't call yourself by her name."</p>
<p>Abigail launched to her feet, her anger exploding.</p>
<p>Her scales turned black, her eyes glowed blue, her hair shone a brilliant white, and the light fled the room, leaving only her outline. Her voice echoed, "Anima in tenebris. Ego non debilis. Sum Morte."</p>
<p>He cringed as the last word echoed in his mind.</p>
<p><em>Morte</em>… Death.</p>
