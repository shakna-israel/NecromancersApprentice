## Chapter Twelve

Abigail felt the weight of the past few days fading as her feet touched the water.

As the cool liquid ran across her skin she felt the release wash over her, leaving her clean.

The weight of her mind faded, and she could see the world clearly, she felt the focus she could bring to bear.

She laughed, despite herself, and the dryad in front glared back at her, "This is not a safe place, nymph."

Abigail blinked, a smile etched into her face, "It's home."

Her skin had turned to scales, her blue face framed by her brunette tangles, and she shrugged, "There is always danger... But here? In the water? I will always be free."

She stretched out her hands, the water rippling around her, and Abigail shrugged, "This is home."

Before Duke could react she ducked under the water, spinning at high volume as her legs vanished, reforming into a single tail, propelling her beneath the lake in ways most people could only dream of.

The nymph spun as she swam, her eyes taking in everything, the insects that most humans never even realised existed, the algae and moss, all the thousands of colonies, fragile pieces of life.

She could hear the myriad of voices in the water, the ones that no one else ever seemed to hear. The chemical components that communicated between symbiotic lifeforces. The frequencies that no human could ever comprehend that echoed between brothers and sisters. The power of life in the water.

Abigail pulled up short, her legs separating, and she smiled softly at the creature staring at her in disgust.

Forty tentacles stretched from a ball of eyes, all shaded in dark blues and purples. The creature looked at her, curling it's arms in, as an electrical charge built within them, ready to shock her and then eat her.

The water nymph smiled, and twisted her hands in the air, vitamancy passing between them, as she focused on the words in her mind.

The creature paused, shocked.

Abigail glared, clenching her fists.

The creature shrank back into the depths.

She was not prey.

Abigail shot to the surface, spraying water backwards, and she waved to the dryad swimming calmly, barely in sight. He waved back.

She grinned.

Here in the water... She was free.

Fiona was far more used to sneaking around, with a bow or a wand. 

Walking between marching soldiers that made the ground shake with their every step... It was unnerving. 

It was terrifying, really. 

She was running away, and the soldiers knew it, but they simply didn't care. They had their duty, and they would carry it through to the very end. 

But she had a different duty, a different sense of responsibility.

Her duty was to her people, and she had removed the greatest threat they had ever faced, and now... Now she was in a damn awkward position.

Every time she thought of Kyle, she found herself fighting back thoughts and emotions, but in all honesty, what could be more dangerous to the Elvish people than an Aimimancer turned Necromancer?

One who managed to cure her of vampirism?

She... Owed him.

But she had sworn an unbreakable oath to her people.

She was utterly confused.
