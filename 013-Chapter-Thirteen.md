Adrian landed on the shoreline with a thud, cracking the frozen ground, and he kept his eyes fixed on the cave. He spoke loudly, hoping the girl on her hands and knees could comprehend him, "Are you okay, Miss Ignis?" 

He heard her laugh bitterly, and the crunch of ice as she stood up, "Sure. I just somehow managed to kill something that should never existed by seeing something that can't have happened, I'm totally fine." 

Adrian extended a root delicately towards the cave, watching the magical energy washing over it, and he grimaced. He chanced a look back at the nymph, and saw the lack of injury. 

His eyes swept back and he shrugged, "At least you have maintained your sense of humour... This cave is still not safe." 

The nymph shook her head, crystals of ice in her hair jangling, "Uh uh. You've got this one, professor." 

Adrian frowned, "How did you survive, Miss Ignis?" 

"Not a damn clue. I tried to give the thing a soul... Crazy idea." The nymph shivered violently, "Think I gave myself a hallucination." 

Adrian winced, knowing the possibilities, "What sort of hallucination?" 

"Uh... I was the embodiment of death. Used my scythe to gut the creature..." She spoke nervously, trying to hide her anxiety. 

Adrian turned around in surprise, "Say what?" 

It wasn't one of the possibilities that he had considered. 

Then he felt something seize his questing root, and the world vanished from sight.

Fiona yawned, sitting up slowly, instinctively reaching for a bow that was no longer there. 

Her elven eyes darted around the cave, acknowledging the presence and source of each shadow, and she shook her head. 

It wasn't a nightmare. 

The school really as gone - destroyed in a war to find, capture and eliminate the threat that a kid she had known for a couple of days might pose. 

Kyle Kilroy. 

His face appeared in her mind, laughing tiredly, his eyes lit up with an intelligence that had intrigued her from the first moment. 

Hell... Where was Kyle? 

Had he abandoned his crazy idea of bringing the world to peace? Or was he still trying to save a world that had been destroyed by a thousand generations of the past? 

Fiona smiled. 

Kyle wasn't about to let anyone else have the fun. 

She stood up, and the soldiers snapped to attention, and alarm bells sang out in Fiona's head. 

One of the shadows hadn't moved. 

There was one more shadow than there were statues. 

She stomped her foot, yelling, "Solve lapis! Intrusus occidere! Solve lapis, intrusus occidere!" 

Stone shattered, and the shadow fell fluidly to the ground, reshaping, just as the floor exploded upwards. Yet somehow, the form of the creature simply stepped through the shrapnel, moving at impossible speed and angles, stepping into the light. 

The creature howled in agony, stepping backwards, and Fiona smiled, "Don't like the sunlight, vampire?" 

The creature hissed at her from the dark, and then an envelope hit the ground in front of her. Fiona picked it up gingerly and opened it, trusting to her bodyguards. 

```
"Dear Fiona Applesilver, 

This war has taken a toll, and though we have become seperated, I need you to know that I am looking forward to the day I can see you again. 

Peace has been found. 

Or a semblance of peace. 

I have managed to convince the three human nations, New Rome, Balsa, and Malata, to sign a charter along with myself. It's a treaty. We will rebuild the school, and protect each other. The Trolls are somewhat pissy with me, due to being cursed. No sunlight for them. As to the vampires? We have declared war on their homeland. 

However, to finish this treaty, we need a representative from your homeland. 

We need to finish the Draco Charter, bound in an unbreakable vow, with blood, by someone who rules in your homeland. 

Fi... I hate to ask... But should it be you? 

Let the vampire know. He can't hurt you, something to do with the fact that his soul is my plaything. 

Let me know quick, these people are really angry, and ready to lash out. 

So it's the war march soon. 

Kyle, 

Always, your friend." 
```

Fiona stared at the letter and lowered it slowly, "Tell Kyle... Tell him I have a priority to protect my nation. Even from him." 

The vampire laughed, and then it was gone. 

Fiona clenched her fists, "Let's go. Now." 

She was flung up into the open, and she hit the snowy ground running, knowing that time was no longer on her side.
