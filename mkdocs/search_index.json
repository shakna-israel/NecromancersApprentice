You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n3.You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\na.for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\nb.if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\nc.You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. \nSection 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\na.Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\nb.To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nc.The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\n\n\na.This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n\nb.Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n\n1.automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n\n2.upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\n\nc.For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\n\nd.Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n\na.The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n\nb.Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\n\n\na.For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n\nb.To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\n\nc.No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\n\nd.Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.",

            "text": "Chapter One\n\n\nIn a world barely surviving, where an age of ice conquered the one you know, a few stand strong, and a bare few will stand stronger yet.\n\n\nIn a castle, on a cliff, on an island, in one of the more remote parts of the world, lies a school, dedicated to providing the training required to those who may one day be great.\n\n\nOne of those few, one of the students, was named Kyle Kilroy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle scratched his neck, nervous.\n\n\nHe knew he shouldn't be nervous, not really.\n\n\nBut he was.\n\n\nHe sat in class, all the other students chattering away, but Kyle... He knew he sucked with people.\n\n\nHe'd given up a long time ago.\n\n\nThe raggedy professor walked in, the same guy who had given them their introduction, but somehow failed to introduce himself.\n\n\nThe class completely ignored him as the professor stood up at the front of the classroom, except for Kyle.\n\n\nThe professor noticed and looked at Kyle, raising an eyebrow. He shrugged.\n\n\nThe professor sighed and clapped his hands together. Once.\n\n\nOnce was enough, a shockwave passed over the entire room.\n\n\nThe students spun, staring.\n\n\nThe professor rung his hands, \"That hurt. Sorry... Now... I am Professor Jason Bateman. I am here to teach you... The basics. Magic 101, if you will. The College calls this subject Introduction to the Induction of Magical Energies.\"\n\n\nThe class laughed, and Professor Bateman grinned, \"Well... Let's get started. First thing, first. Magic follows rules.\"\n\n\nBateman flicked his wrist and there was a puff of smoke, \"Magic is energy. Energy follows rules.\"\n\n\nHe turned his wrist, and the smoke in the air turned into fire, \"Energy can be transferred, but it can be neither created nor destroyed... So... What does that mean for a magic user?\"\n\n\nBateman looked around the room and rolled his eyes, \"Please? Anyone?\"\n\n\nKyle sighed and raised his hand, the professor grinned, \"Yes. Kyle.\"\n\n\nThe boy winced at that, the professor knowing who he was wasn't something the others would have missed.\n\n\n\"Magic is energy, and we transfer it, but we can't create it. So we transfer it from ourselves, and we have a limit.\" Kyle said with confidence, and Bateman nodded, \"Good.\"\n\n\nHe looked around the room, \"So, how about someone else tells me how we transfer energy from ourselves into the real world?\"\n\n\nA big wave of silence hit the room.\n\n\nBateman sighed, \"Fine. Crack out your textbooks.\"\n\n\nA dozen hands shot into the air, and Bateman laughed and pointed to someone else, \"Fiona.\"\n\n\nThe girl swallowed nervously, \"Most magic users have to use a channel. They use something magically conductive, like a wand or staff, to transfer the magic from their bodies out to the world. Sometimes controlled, sometimes not.\"\n\n\nBateman nodded, \"Excellent. That is a key point. Using magic... Is dangerous. If you don't focus, you could do far worse than blow a foot off. I know people, who used to be my friends, we went to this school together... Some of them have no memories. Some of them are missing organs and bones... Others have parts that they were never meant to have in the first place.\"\n\n\nThe professor's unusually serious face faded and he rubbed his hands together, \"I think we have time for one more thing. We are going to make a charm that can help you out while you're learning. It will block you from using magic while you are wearing it, and you will be expected to wear it at all times from now on, unless you are instructed to remove it.\"\n\n\nKyle rubbed his temples, a simple object, true enough... But it would hurt like hell for him to wear... But he should have expected it.\n\n\nBateman continued to talk, but Kyle wasn't listening. He examined the wooden desk carefully, and found a small splinter.\n\n\nHe plucked it and stabbed his hand, wincing. He pulled it out, glancing at the tiny drop of blood on the end, and he touched it, muttering, \"Magicae per se stetisse, cum in te gerit.\"\n\n\nThe splinter shivered and changed shape, expanding into a circle, and a small set of beads grew out from it.\n\n\n\"Kyle!\" Bateman yelled angrily, and he glanced up at the professor, who shook his head, \"I wasn't going to use Aimimancy. I was teaching you basic Terramancy. I would prefer you pay attention. Aptitude does not mean that you are destined for one school.\"\n\n\nKyle winced as everyone stared at him.\n\n\nHe could hear the whispers.\n\n\nBlood Mancer.\n\n\nHe winced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer name was Fiona Applesilver.\n\n\nSo far, her time at the school had been utter hell.\n\n\nShe wasn't entirely used to it. She knew why everyone hated her - that was all fair enough. The Applesilver family had lead the war, Elves against Humans.\n\n\nBut humans... They didn't blame the families behind the war.\n\n\nThey blamed all elves.\n\n\nAnd so, her brilliant gold hair, pointed ears, and eyes with vertical coloured slits instead of irises, marked her out. \n\n\nThat being said, the school wasn't all just students. If anyone developed an aptitude or interest in magic... They were sent to one of the Eight Schools of Magic around the world.\n\n\nHer family had chosen this one for her, as the least harsh.\n\n\nA ball of wind and rock slammed into the side of her head, knocking her onto the table, and she touched her head gingerly, feeling the blood.\n\n\nRage gripped her and she stood up.\n\n\nHer fists tensed and she glared at the room.\n\n\nThe ground began to rumble, and the entire hall fell silent, except for one or two students determined to continue eating.\n\n\nHer ears quivered at their tips, and her golden eyes turned red, \"Only an idiot throws a rock at an elf.\"\n\n\nAnother voice spoke, one she recognized, but was surprised to hear, \"No one will do that again, if they expect to live.\"\n\n\nShe glanced over at a professor, a young one, wandering over to her.\n\n\nHe was of average human height, with red curls, wearing a black cloak with red lining, with a bright red capital 'A' stitched into one of the breasts.\n\n\nHe touched the side of her face gingerly, and then rubbed the blood between two of his fingers.\n\n\nHe turned around and glared at the students, and then spoke quietly, \"Surge proditor, studioque cudentur. Surge proditor, studioque cudentur.\"\n\n\nOne of the students jumped onto the table, a man more than a boy, with three scars criss-crossing his face, \"I am the traitor you seek.\"\n\n\nHe then proceeded to be incredibly astonished at what he had done.\n\n\nThe professor laughed, \"Sit down then, boy... And know that I am the Head for the School of Aimimancy. I am likely the most powerful Aimimancer you will ever meet... And as protocol, every student here donated some blood. For if you ran away before you were trained... So I could bend you to my will... Another attack on Miss Applesilver... I might bend it a little earlier.\"\n\n\nThen he turned and walked over to the canteen and proceeded to order his lunch.\n\n\nFiona managed a smile and sat down, blinking as she saw another student at her table, a young boy.\n\n\nShe laughed, \"You really want to make best friends with an elf?\"\n\n\n\"Never had friends before.\" He said and picked a meatball up with a plastic fork, \"Never seen the need.\"\n\n\nShe glared, \"Then why do you think that I want you here?\"\n\n\n\"You don't.\" The boy said with a shrug, \"But I'm not moving... Everyone is avoiding you right now, and well... I'd rather not be recognized. So this seems a good place to sit.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, \"Hell... You're Kyle Kilroy.\"\n\n\nHe winced, \"Yes.\"\n\n\nFiona laughed, \"And I thought I was hated by the school... You're the youngest Aimimancer in a thousand years.\"\n\n\nHe winced, \"Most Aimimancers tend to die young, before they're discovered. So I'm not entirely unique.\"\n\n\nShe laughed, \"You invented no less than eight new spells, before you were ten. You, kid, are a magical genius at a magic that most people think is... Disgusting.\"\n\n\nKyle glanced at her carefully, \"You aren't sure what to think?\"\n\n\n\"The Head of Aimimancy just saved me a lot of embarrassment and swore to protect me... So you can't all be bad.\" She said with a shrug.\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"I think I should explain. I wasn't trying to learn Aimimancy. I was trying to discover something worse. My mother died. Killed by bandits. They tore her limb from limb.\"\n\n\nFiona stared at him in horror, \"You were trying to become... A Necromancer?\"\n\n\nHe nodded with a visible twinge of pain, \"Yeah.\"\n\n\nFiona shook her head, \"Kid... You're an absolute freak... But sort of interesting.\" She smiled, \"Stick around. Maybe you might actually make a friend.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, a look of absolute disbelief etched into his face, \"I highly doubt it... Why did Professor Bateman know you?\"\n\n\nThe tips of her ears tend red, and she swallowed, \"I... I'm sort of... Famous. Amongst elves.\"\n\n\nKyle blinked, \"Like me, you mean? Someone famous for magic?\"\n\n\nFiona bit her cheek and sighed, \"Fine. May as well say, you'll find out eventually. Most elves are awesome at magic. We do our first spell at birth. It's in our blood, and we don't have to use worded spells, like humans. Thinking them is enough... Most elves become adept at Aeromancy or Aquamancy, and it's apparent before their sixteenth birthday. Me, I'm a late bloomer. I wasn't particularly adept at any magic until I was sixty three... And the magic I suddenly became great at using... Was Terramancy.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"Huh... I don't see the big deal there... Also, exactly how old are you? You look about twelve, like me.\"\n\n\nFiona's ears quivered with irritation, \"Elves rarely learn anything but air or water magics. When they do, they're freaks. Either magicless or utterly insane. I am more skilled at Terramancy than the Head at this school.\"\n\n\nKyle cocked his head, \"You skipped over your age there. Also, why didn't you stop the rock from hitting your head?\"\n\n\nFiona sighed, \"Didn't want to give anybody more reason to attack me... But Professor Bracken has taken care of that.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"If it's any consolation, I would be happy to watch your back.\"\n\n\nFiona winced, \"So the only people who like me are Aimimancers? No... Nope. No consolation there.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"Professor Bracken is a half elf.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, \"Oh. That explains a lot.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle sighed as he walked, heavy books in hand, towards his next class.\n\n\nAt least lunch had been interesting. Fiona was... Fascinating.\n\n\nShe hadn't minded that he was a total sociopath. She was almost as cynical as he was. \n\n\nKyle smiled at the memory, and then someone brushed his shoulder, scattering his books onto the floor.\n\n\nHe glared over at another first year striding past, a girl surrounded by others, and she glared back at him, \"Watch where you're going, freak!\"\n\n\nKyle sighed, word had got around.\n\n\nHe bent down to pick up his books, when an ear-piercing scream filled the corridor, suddenly cutting off as a sort of warble.\n\n\nHe glanced up and blinked.\n\n\nThe student that had pushed him was dancing around clutching at her mouth.\n\n\nKyle picked up his books and stood up, scratching his head.\n\n\nAnother girl shoved the hysterical girl, and then walked over, \"You doing okay, aimi?\"\n\n\nHe raised an eyebrow, \"Amy?\"\n\n\n\"Short for Aimimancer.\" She shrugged, and he blinked, \"Wow... I've only heard that kind of slang on the beach.\"\n\n\nShe blushed and scratched the back of her neck, \"Heh. Yeah. Beaches are fun.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, glancing back at the girl still emitting muffled screams, \"What did you do to her?\"\n\n\n\"Removed her mouth. Kind of feeling sorry, so I might give it back... But replace her tongue with a snake's.\" The brunette grinned at him, \"What do you think?\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"You're a rebel. Trying to make friends.\"\n\n\nShe shrugged, \"Everyone knows you're freak, Kyle... But, in my experience, freaks are awesome fun to be around. I reckon you'll be totes fun.\"\n\n\nKyle didn't know what to say.\n\n\n\"You'll let a fly in.\"\n\n\nKyle glared and closed his mouth, \"So who are you?\"\n\n\nShe shook her head, turning, \"Just a minute... Dimittite, creagras, et os eius et lingua eius.\"\n\n\nThe muffled screams morphed into a high pitch hiss.\n\n\nThe brunette turned back to Kyle, \"Now where were we... Oh right. Me. My name is Abigail, I'm pretty good at Vitamancy. Anything living is clay in my hands...\" She frowned and then grinned, \"Oh, I'm a water nymph.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"I... Don't see any scales...\"\n\n\nAbigail rolled her eyes, \"I only go full mermaid in water, dinkus.\"\n\n\nHe laughed, \"Right. Well, I'm headed to Introduction to the Induction of Magical Energies, again. You?\"\n\n\n\"Probably detention.\" She shrugged, and as if on cue a professor shouted from nearby, \"Abigail Ingis! What in the Shades did you do this time?\"\n\n\nShe smiled, \"Nice to meet you, Kyle.\" The water nymph turned and walked towards the nearby crowd, and yelled with a sweet voice, \"Coming!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBateman was enigmatic, and a little bit pissed with Kyle.\n\n\nHe reinforced that students would not get a staff or wand until they finished first year and entered one of the Schools. As to anyone practicing Aimimancy, which did not require anything but their own blood to be able to generate spells of decent power... If they were ever caught misusing their power, they would be Broken on the spot.\n\n\nKyle winced at the thought.\n\n\nBeing Broken... It was any magic wielder's worst nightmare. It literally stripped away half your soul. It cut you off from the gift that changed the way you viewed the world.\n\n\nIt basically turned you into a wandering madman.\n\n\nOver half of the students that were sent to the Eight Schools of Magic left that way.\n\n\nHe had just under three hundred days to make sure it didn't happen to him.\n\n\nBateman's voice interrupted his thoughts, \"... Now, to finish the bond between you and your transference device, you actually need another mage. Only a mage of the opposite school to you may finish the bond. So only a Terramancer may finish a Pyromancer's staff or wand. Only a Necromancer may finish the bond for a Vitamancer, and so on and so forth.\"\n\n\nKyle's hand shot up, and Bateman nodded towards him, \"Isn't there only one Necromancer in the world?\"\n\n\nBateman smiled, \"Yes. Professor Duke is the only currently known Necromancer in the world. Due to this, most Vitamancers are unable to create wands, staffs, or any sort of object that can aid them to channel their abilities, and so, consequently, their magic is usually quite weak. There are a few people in the world who can transfigure themselves or others\u2026.\" The professor paused, dusting his ragged cloak, \"There are\u2026 Exceptions to this, however. Most nymphs and pixies can bypass these laws, due to their ability to imprint onto those that they wish to perform magic on. They make the victim the vessel for their powers.\"\n\n\nKyle was rapt, and paid sharp attention as Bateman continued, \"As I was saying, when it comes time to create your transference device at the end of this year, so long as you pass your exam into one of our Schools, becoming a mancer of a particular art, then you will require someone from one of the opposite Schools to aid you\u2026 We do not supply one for you. You must find a friend, or convince an enemy, to finish the bonding for you\u2026 But be warned, if it is an enemy who finishes your bonding\u2026 They could well block all magic from you, forever\u2026 Or worse.\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"We tell you this at the start of the school year for a reason.\"\n\n\nThe clock chimed overhead and Bateman smiled, \"Back to the Great Hall, for dinner, and then to the dorms. Be careful not to get lost. Not all students here, are here by choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle sat down at the same table, surprised when the elf from lunch appeared shortly after. She smiled as she sat, \"I hope dinner is something a little\u2026 Nicer\u2026 Than lunch.\"\n\n\nHe rolled his eyes, \"It\u2019s a school. What do you expect?\"\n\n\nFiona smiled, \"It's a school of mages. Can we really not do better than microwaved pasta?\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"A Vitamancer could probably make it taste nicer\u2026 But you might have to kill it first.\"\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes and then turned as they heard a glass being tapped repeatedly.\n\n\nThe room dropped to a hush, and Kyle stared, \"Is that the Headmaster? I\u2026 I never thought I'd actually see him.\"\n\n\nThe man standing at the end of the room, behind a long table where all the staff sat, was an impressive sight. Even if one did not know who he was, fear and surprise would grip you tight.\n\n\nHe didn't wear a cloak, like all staff and children, rather, he was covered in an assortment of hard red scales, knitted tightly into an impenetrable armour, as well as black stripes of leather. None of it appeared as clothes, but more as a second skin.\n\n\nHeadmaster Bellum Draco smiled softly, as everyone stared, and he spoke softly, but his tones rang out, not in volume, but in the soul. You felt him speak into you, rather than at you. \"Welcome, students.\"\n\n\nHe smiled and shrugged, \"Today was the beginning of a new year, and we are\u2026 We are blessed to have so many of you. Thousands of mages-to-be, from across the globe. Some of you have chosen to be here, and for that, we are exceedingly grateful.\" The man's expression darkened, and all the lights seemed to flicker, \"However, many of you were forced to attend, after learning things too dangerous for you to handle... At least you are not ready, yet. It is to these, and anybody who believes misbehaviour can be rewarded, that I speak now. My name means 'War Dragon', I am the only known offspring between a human and a dragon. Which leaves me as the most powerful Ventusamancer that this world has ever seen. I have never developed skill, because I have never found a match for my abilities. If this does not dissuade you, the staff here are among the most powerful and skilled mages in the known world. Blood was taken from every student as you arrived. Professor Bracken, is an incredibly skilled Aimimancer. If you run away, or prove to be excessively troublesome, rather than tracking you down or bringing you back here, I will simply order your execution, and it will be done.\"\n\n\nKyle felt a chill run down his back at those words, and the Headmaster shrugged, \"But for tonight, at least, we feast.\"\n\n\nWaiters and waitresses appeared from the kitchens, moving on small enchanted wisps of air, skating through the crowds, depositing food and drinks as they went.\n\n\nKyle smiled as it appeared in front of him, \"Roast chicken. Hard to see how they could screw this up.\"\n\n\nFiona breathed in raggedly, obviously shocked by the vehemence of the Headmaster's speech, and then glanced at her food with a look of disgust, \"Seriously? More meat?\"\n\n\nHe glanced at her, \"Wait\u2026 You don't eat meat? Really? It's not just a stereotype?\"\n\n\nFiona glared, \"Of course it is a stereotype. It's just\u2026 Whacky flavours to me.\"\n\n\nKyle raised an eyebrow and Fiona sighed, \"Fine. Most elves are vegetarian. We kind of\u2026 See the soul that died\u2026 When we eat.\"\n\n\nHe winced, \"Ouch. Vitamancy has some drawbacks.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah.\" Fiona shrugged, \"Thankfully it doesn't seem to be one of my talents.\"\n\n\nShe pierced a potato and ate it slowly, considering how few vegetables had been put on her plate. The sliced chicken breast took up the majority of the plate, and the whole thing was swamped in a thick brown gravy.\n\n\nKyle loved it.\n\n\nRight up until his chicken stood up.\n\n\nHis fists clenched and he glared around, wincing as he heard a girl giggle behind him, \"Vitamancy also has some benefits.\"\n\n\nKyle rolled his eyes, \"Fiona, this is Abigail.\" He turned, \"Abigail, Fiona Applesilver.\"\n\n\nAbigail grinned and sat down, thankfully, Kyle's chicken reverted to its natural dead and food-like state. The elf eyed her suspiciously, \"Why did they send you here? Troublemaking?\"\n\n\nThe brunette shrugged, \"I'm a nymph. What do people expect?\"\n\n\nFiona's jaw clenched, \"I haven't had much of a good history with\u2026 Nymphs.\"\n\n\nAbigail yawned, \"Meh. I slept with an elven prince once\u2026 He was pretty good, but sort of\u2026 Dry and boring.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, \"Nymphs actually sleep around?\"\n\n\n\"No!\" Abigail yelled angrily, her skin flashing to blue scales and back to a pale white skin in a wave. She winced, \"Look, nymphs don't wait on the guy, and we're pretty forward. On top of that\u2026 We don't know how to tell lies. No idea how deception works. So\u2026 Put those together and people see us as pretty\u2026 Slutty.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, and both girls glared at him in unison, \"What?\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"Both of you\u2026 Perfect match.\"\n\n\nAbigail glared, \"Do you want me to make your mouth disappear, too?\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"How did that go by the way? With the snake tongue?\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, \"Snake tongue? No mouth?\"\n\n\n\"One of the high-and-might bitches knocked Kyle's books onto the floor, so I made her shut up. By making her mouth disappear. Before the panic attack made her suffocate I gave her mouth back, but replaced her tongue with a snake's.\" Abigail grinned, \"It was pretty funny. Anyways, one of the professors caught me, I owned up straightaway, and he tried to fix the girl's tongue. By reversing my spell.\"\n\n\nFiona smiled, \"Which just made her go back to having no mouth, right?\"\n\n\nAbigail grinned, \"This one gets it. Yeah, and he kind of freaked and gave her back the snake tongue and demanded to know how to fix her. I refused.\"\n\n\nFiona's jaw dropped, \"You told a professor 'no' to his face? You looking to get Broken?\"\n\n\nAbigail rolled her eyes, \"Right. They could totally Break me. I transfigured a girl I had never met from ten feet away.\"\n\n\nFiona shook her head, \"Professor Gallagher could transfigure you into an ant from over at the staff table. You are above average, but not that impressive.\"\n\n\nAbigail sighed, \"You're probably right\u2026 But\u2026 I just can't stand rules. No idea how to live under them. But, anyways\u2026 I was late to dinner because of detention.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"What did you do for detention?\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"It wasn't\u2026 Pleasant.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, \"We're all ears. A nymph not wanting to tell?\"\n\n\nThe water nymph rubbed her eyes, \"Guys\u2026 Just\u2026 I'll tell you tomorrow. Just not tonight.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, feeling an odd mixture of emotion, and awkwardly patted the girl's arm. She stared at him, \"Dude. Thanks\u2026 But don't touch me again.\"\n\n\nHe looked at her dumbfounded and Fiona glared at him, \"Kyle. You're an Aimimancer. She's a Vitamancer. You just showed her your soul.\"\n\n\nHis face drained of colour, \"Damn\u2026 I am so\u2026 so\u2026 sorry\u2026\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled weakly, \"It wasn't\u2026 As terrible as I thought it would be.\" She shrugged, \"Not that you aren't dark. You're nearly pitch black\u2026 I just expected a bit more insanity to you, is all.\"\n\n\n\"Don't pity me.\" He said quickly, with less force than he had meant, and Abigail laughed, \"Kyle, I didn't mean it. It's just something that would take some getting used to\u2026 A Vitamancer doesn't just see your soul\u2026 They see the defining memories that colour your life. Watching a dozen people die, someone's descent into madness, or someone's greatest fears\u2026 Not something you can handle when you're as young as I am.\"\n\n\nKyle turned, \"That reminds me, Fiona, how old are you?\"\n\n\nAbigail smacked him over the back of the head, \"Shut up, Kyle. She's an elf, and that's rude.\"\n\n\nThe water nymph winced, \"And\u2026 I'm sorry. I'm going to bed\u2026 I don't feel well.\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, \"Wait. You feel awful from Kyle and whatever evil thing detention was. Can I try and give you a cure?\"\n\n\nAbigail glared, \"The stuck up soul of an elf? No thanks.\"\n\n\n\"Not me.\" She smiled, \"Professor Maidr. Head of Sanamancy.\"\n\n\nAbigail blinked, \"Huh. I guess that might work. Sanamancy means using your hopes and dreams to help people, right? Heal them?\"\n\n\n\"It does, child.\"\n\n\nAbigail froze up in fear and turned around slowly, wide-eyed, and blinked at the pixie floating behind her, who smiled sweetly, \"And you, my dear, would not do well to see my soul.\"\n\n\nThe water nymph nodded slowly, \"I understand, professor.\"\n\n\nThe pixie shrugged, scattering a twinkling of magical dust, \"But I can help you. I know what detention was tonight\u2026 A deserved punishment, I believe. But\u2026 I am not without mercy.\"\n\n\nThe professor flicked her fingers quickly, in a blurred motion, and a small yellow glowing ball, no bigger than an eye appeared, and she gently pushed it into Abigail's head, and into her skull.\n\n\nThe pixie withdrew her arm, and darted away, and Abigail grabbed her head, her elbows falling to the table, \"OMG, this really hurts.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"What the hell did she do to you?\"\n\n\nFiona swallowed, \"She placed a Vault inside Abigail's head. A place that can trap unwanted memories, for a short time. The Vault collapses when you sleep next, and the memories come back. Gives you some fairly terrible nightmares.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled weakly, \"Yeah\u2026 Except I don't like forgetting things, so it's sapping my magic instead.\"\n\n\nThe two looked at her in concern and she stood up, \"I'm going for a swim.\"\n\n\nThe water nymph strode off, still holding her head, and Fiona winced, \"That was my fault\u2026 I should go after her.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Why?\"\n\n\n\"Because that is what nice people do for each other, sociopath.\" Fiona growled and stood up, storming into the hall.\n\n\nHe scratched his head, \"What did I say?\"\n\n\n\"You're an idiot.\" Came a dark growl, and Kyle spun to see the Head of Aimimancy standing over him with an angry expression, \"I heard you used Aimimancy to create your amulet today.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded slowly, \"I did.\"\n\n\n\"Why?\" Came the brutally flat question, and he shrugged, \"I\u2026 I struggle to pay attention with the basics. So I skipped ahead without waiting for the professor to explain.\"\n\n\n\"I repeat myself.\" Professor Bracken glared, \"You are an idiot. You may know magic, and a lot of Aimimancy. I've read some of your work, myself, and it is brilliant\u2026 But if you do not understand people, how could you ever use them? If you cannot understand people, or work with them\u2026 Then you'll be a hermit, and forgotten. To someone of your talents\u2026 Breaking you would be a pleasant alternative than the insanity that would bring on your mind.\"\n\n\nKyle cringed, \"Sorry, professor. I\u2026 I have not felt many things in my life.\"\n\n\nBracken nodded, \"I am aware. I saw you care for Abigail this evening\u2026 That was friendship you felt. Try and preserve it\u2026 If you cannot make at least one friend\u2026 How would you ever enter my School? You do have a lot you could learn from me\u2026 But a mage you will never be if you do not learn what friendship means.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded and stood, \"This is where I chase after her, and console her, correct?\"\n\n\n\"Don't follow a trope.\" Bracken said with scorn, \"Be what you are.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed in confusion and walked from the hall.",

            "text": "In a world barely surviving, where an age of ice conquered the one you know, a few stand strong, and a bare few will stand stronger yet.  In a castle, on a cliff, on an island, in one of the more remote parts of the world, lies a school, dedicated to providing the training required to those who may one day be great.  One of those few, one of the students, was named Kyle Kilroy.    Kyle scratched his neck, nervous.  He knew he shouldn't be nervous, not really.  But he was.  He sat in class, all the other students chattering away, but Kyle... He knew he sucked with people.  He'd given up a long time ago.  The raggedy professor walked in, the same guy who had given them their introduction, but somehow failed to introduce himself.  The class completely ignored him as the professor stood up at the front of the classroom, except for Kyle.  The professor noticed and looked at Kyle, raising an eyebrow. He shrugged.  The professor sighed and clapped his hands together. Once.  Once was enough, a shockwave passed over the entire room.  The students spun, staring.  The professor rung his hands, \"That hurt. Sorry... Now... I am Professor Jason Bateman. I am here to teach you... The basics. Magic 101, if you will. The College calls this subject Introduction to the Induction of Magical Energies.\"  The class laughed, and Professor Bateman grinned, \"Well... Let's get started. First thing, first. Magic follows rules.\"  Bateman flicked his wrist and there was a puff of smoke, \"Magic is energy. Energy follows rules.\"  He turned his wrist, and the smoke in the air turned into fire, \"Energy can be transferred, but it can be neither created nor destroyed... So... What does that mean for a magic user?\"  Bateman looked around the room and rolled his eyes, \"Please? Anyone?\"  Kyle sighed and raised his hand, the professor grinned, \"Yes. Kyle.\"  The boy winced at that, the professor knowing who he was wasn't something the others would have missed.  \"Magic is energy, and we transfer it, but we can't create it. So we transfer it from ourselves, and we have a limit.\" Kyle said with confidence, and Bateman nodded, \"Good.\"  He looked around the room, \"So, how about someone else tells me how we transfer energy from ourselves into the real world?\"  A big wave of silence hit the room.  Bateman sighed, \"Fine. Crack out your textbooks.\"  A dozen hands shot into the air, and Bateman laughed and pointed to someone else, \"Fiona.\"  The girl swallowed nervously, \"Most magic users have to use a channel. They use something magically conductive, like a wand or staff, to transfer the magic from their bodies out to the world. Sometimes controlled, sometimes not.\"  Bateman nodded, \"Excellent. That is a key point. Using magic... Is dangerous. If you don't focus, you could do far worse than blow a foot off. I know people, who used to be my friends, we went to this school together... Some of them have no memories. Some of them are missing organs and bones... Others have parts that they were never meant to have in the first place.\"  The professor's unusually serious face faded and he rubbed his hands together, \"I think we have time for one more thing. We are going to make a charm that can help you out while you're learning. It will block you from using magic while you are wearing it, and you will be expected to wear it at all times from now on, unless you are instructed to remove it.\"  Kyle rubbed his temples, a simple object, true enough... But it would hurt like hell for him to wear... But he should have expected it.  Bateman continued to talk, but Kyle wasn't listening. He examined the wooden desk carefully, and found a small splinter.  He plucked it and stabbed his hand, wincing. He pulled it out, glancing at the tiny drop of blood on the end, and he touched it, muttering, \"Magicae per se stetisse, cum in te gerit.\"  The splinter shivered and changed shape, expanding into a circle, and a small set of beads grew out from it.  \"Kyle!\" Bateman yelled angrily, and he glanced up at the professor, who shook his head, \"I wasn't going to use Aimimancy. I was teaching you basic Terramancy. I would prefer you pay attention. Aptitude does not mean that you are destined for one school.\"  Kyle winced as everyone stared at him.  He could hear the whispers.  Blood Mancer.  He winced.    Her name was Fiona Applesilver.  So far, her time at the school had been utter hell.  She wasn't entirely used to it. She knew why everyone hated her - that was all fair enough. The Applesilver family had lead the war, Elves against Humans.  But humans... They didn't blame the families behind the war.  They blamed all elves.  And so, her brilliant gold hair, pointed ears, and eyes with vertical coloured slits instead of irises, marked her out.   That being said, the school wasn't all just students. If anyone developed an aptitude or interest in magic... They were sent to one of the Eight Schools of Magic around the world.  Her family had chosen this one for her, as the least harsh.  A ball of wind and rock slammed into the side of her head, knocking her onto the table, and she touched her head gingerly, feeling the blood.  Rage gripped her and she stood up.  Her fists tensed and she glared at the room.  The ground began to rumble, and the entire hall fell silent, except for one or two students determined to continue eating.  Her ears quivered at their tips, and her golden eyes turned red, \"Only an idiot throws a rock at an elf.\"  Another voice spoke, one she recognized, but was surprised to hear, \"No one will do that again, if they expect to live.\"  She glanced over at a professor, a young one, wandering over to her.  He was of average human height, with red curls, wearing a black cloak with red lining, with a bright red capital 'A' stitched into one of the breasts.  He touched the side of her face gingerly, and then rubbed the blood between two of his fingers.  He turned around and glared at the students, and then spoke quietly, \"Surge proditor, studioque cudentur. Surge proditor, studioque cudentur.\"  One of the students jumped onto the table, a man more than a boy, with three scars criss-crossing his face, \"I am the traitor you seek.\"  He then proceeded to be incredibly astonished at what he had done.  The professor laughed, \"Sit down then, boy... And know that I am the Head for the School of Aimimancy. I am likely the most powerful Aimimancer you will ever meet... And as protocol, every student here donated some blood. For if you ran away before you were trained... So I could bend you to my will... Another attack on Miss Applesilver... I might bend it a little earlier.\"  Then he turned and walked over to the canteen and proceeded to order his lunch.  Fiona managed a smile and sat down, blinking as she saw another student at her table, a young boy.  She laughed, \"You really want to make best friends with an elf?\"  \"Never had friends before.\" He said and picked a meatball up with a plastic fork, \"Never seen the need.\"  She glared, \"Then why do you think that I want you here?\"  \"You don't.\" The boy said with a shrug, \"But I'm not moving... Everyone is avoiding you right now, and well... I'd rather not be recognized. So this seems a good place to sit.\"  Fiona blinked, \"Hell... You're Kyle Kilroy.\"  He winced, \"Yes.\"  Fiona laughed, \"And I thought I was hated by the school... You're the youngest Aimimancer in a thousand years.\"  He winced, \"Most Aimimancers tend to die young, before they're discovered. So I'm not entirely unique.\"  She laughed, \"You invented no less than eight new spells, before you were ten. You, kid, are a magical genius at a magic that most people think is... Disgusting.\"  Kyle glanced at her carefully, \"You aren't sure what to think?\"  \"The Head of Aimimancy just saved me a lot of embarrassment and swore to protect me... So you can't all be bad.\" She said with a shrug.  Kyle laughed, \"I think I should explain. I wasn't trying to learn Aimimancy. I was trying to discover something worse. My mother died. Killed by bandits. They tore her limb from limb.\"  Fiona stared at him in horror, \"You were trying to become... A Necromancer?\"  He nodded with a visible twinge of pain, \"Yeah.\"  Fiona shook her head, \"Kid... You're an absolute freak... But sort of interesting.\" She smiled, \"Stick around. Maybe you might actually make a friend.\"  Kyle laughed, a look of absolute disbelief etched into his face, \"I highly doubt it... Why did Professor Bateman know you?\"  The tips of her ears tend red, and she swallowed, \"I... I'm sort of... Famous. Amongst elves.\"  Kyle blinked, \"Like me, you mean? Someone famous for magic?\"  Fiona bit her cheek and sighed, \"Fine. May as well say, you'll find out eventually. Most elves are awesome at magic. We do our first spell at birth. It's in our blood, and we don't have to use worded spells, like humans. Thinking them is enough... Most elves become adept at Aeromancy or Aquamancy, and it's apparent before their sixteenth birthday. Me, I'm a late bloomer. I wasn't particularly adept at any magic until I was sixty three... And the magic I suddenly became great at using... Was Terramancy.\"  Kyle frowned, \"Huh... I don't see the big deal there... Also, exactly how old are you? You look about twelve, like me.\"  Fiona's ears quivered with irritation, \"Elves rarely learn anything but air or water magics. When they do, they're freaks. Either magicless or utterly insane. I am more skilled at Terramancy than the Head at this school.\"  Kyle cocked his head, \"You skipped over your age there. Also, why didn't you stop the rock from hitting your head?\"  Fiona sighed, \"Didn't want to give anybody more reason to attack me... But Professor Bracken has taken care of that.\"  Kyle smiled, \"If it's any consolation, I would be happy to watch your back.\"  Fiona winced, \"So the only people who like me are Aimimancers? No... Nope. No consolation there.\"  Kyle smiled, \"Professor Bracken is a half elf.\"  Fiona blinked, \"Oh. That explains a lot.\"    Kyle sighed as he walked, heavy books in hand, towards his next class.  At least lunch had been interesting. Fiona was... Fascinating.  She hadn't minded that he was a total sociopath. She was almost as cynical as he was.   Kyle smiled at the memory, and then someone brushed his shoulder, scattering his books onto the floor.  He glared over at another first year striding past, a girl surrounded by others, and she glared back at him, \"Watch where you're going, freak!\"  Kyle sighed, word had got around.  He bent down to pick up his books, when an ear-piercing scream filled the corridor, suddenly cutting off as a sort of warble.  He glanced up and blinked.  The student that had pushed him was dancing around clutching at her mouth.  Kyle picked up his books and stood up, scratching his head.  Another girl shoved the hysterical girl, and then walked over, \"You doing okay, aimi?\"  He raised an eyebrow, \"Amy?\"  \"Short for Aimimancer.\" She shrugged, and he blinked, \"Wow... I've only heard that kind of slang on the beach.\"  She blushed and scratched the back of her neck, \"Heh. Yeah. Beaches are fun.\"  Kyle frowned, glancing back at the girl still emitting muffled screams, \"What did you do to her?\"  \"Removed her mouth. Kind of feeling sorry, so I might give it back... But replace her tongue with a snake's.\" The brunette grinned at him, \"What do you think?\"  Kyle laughed, \"You're a rebel. Trying to make friends.\"  She shrugged, \"Everyone knows you're freak, Kyle... But, in my experience, freaks are awesome fun to be around. I reckon you'll be totes fun.\"  Kyle didn't know what to say.  \"You'll let a fly in.\"  Kyle glared and closed his mouth, \"So who are you?\"  She shook her head, turning, \"Just a minute... Dimittite, creagras, et os eius et lingua eius.\"  The muffled screams morphed into a high pitch hiss.  The brunette turned back to Kyle, \"Now where were we... Oh right. Me. My name is Abigail, I'm pretty good at Vitamancy. Anything living is clay in my hands...\" She frowned and then grinned, \"Oh, I'm a water nymph.\"  Kyle frowned, \"I... Don't see any scales...\"  Abigail rolled her eyes, \"I only go full mermaid in water, dinkus.\"  He laughed, \"Right. Well, I'm headed to Introduction to the Induction of Magical Energies, again. You?\"  \"Probably detention.\" She shrugged, and as if on cue a professor shouted from nearby, \"Abigail Ingis! What in the Shades did you do this time?\"  She smiled, \"Nice to meet you, Kyle.\" The water nymph turned and walked towards the nearby crowd, and yelled with a sweet voice, \"Coming!\"    Bateman was enigmatic, and a little bit pissed with Kyle.  He reinforced that students would not get a staff or wand until they finished first year and entered one of the Schools. As to anyone practicing Aimimancy, which did not require anything but their own blood to be able to generate spells of decent power... If they were ever caught misusing their power, they would be Broken on the spot.  Kyle winced at the thought.  Being Broken... It was any magic wielder's worst nightmare. It literally stripped away half your soul. It cut you off from the gift that changed the way you viewed the world.  It basically turned you into a wandering madman.  Over half of the students that were sent to the Eight Schools of Magic left that way.  He had just under three hundred days to make sure it didn't happen to him.  Bateman's voice interrupted his thoughts, \"... Now, to finish the bond between you and your transference device, you actually need another mage. Only a mage of the opposite school to you may finish the bond. So only a Terramancer may finish a Pyromancer's staff or wand. Only a Necromancer may finish the bond for a Vitamancer, and so on and so forth.\"  Kyle's hand shot up, and Bateman nodded towards him, \"Isn't there only one Necromancer in the world?\"  Bateman smiled, \"Yes. Professor Duke is the only currently known Necromancer in the world. Due to this, most Vitamancers are unable to create wands, staffs, or any sort of object that can aid them to channel their abilities, and so, consequently, their magic is usually quite weak. There are a few people in the world who can transfigure themselves or others\u2026.\" The professor paused, dusting his ragged cloak, \"There are\u2026 Exceptions to this, however. Most nymphs and pixies can bypass these laws, due to their ability to imprint onto those that they wish to perform magic on. They make the victim the vessel for their powers.\"  Kyle was rapt, and paid sharp attention as Bateman continued, \"As I was saying, when it comes time to create your transference device at the end of this year, so long as you pass your exam into one of our Schools, becoming a mancer of a particular art, then you will require someone from one of the opposite Schools to aid you\u2026 We do not supply one for you. You must find a friend, or convince an enemy, to finish the bonding for you\u2026 But be warned, if it is an enemy who finishes your bonding\u2026 They could well block all magic from you, forever\u2026 Or worse.\"  He shrugged, \"We tell you this at the start of the school year for a reason.\"  The clock chimed overhead and Bateman smiled, \"Back to the Great Hall, for dinner, and then to the dorms. Be careful not to get lost. Not all students here, are here by choice.\"    Kyle sat down at the same table, surprised when the elf from lunch appeared shortly after. She smiled as she sat, \"I hope dinner is something a little\u2026 Nicer\u2026 Than lunch.\"  He rolled his eyes, \"It\u2019s a school. What do you expect?\"  Fiona smiled, \"It's a school of mages. Can we really not do better than microwaved pasta?\"  He shrugged, \"A Vitamancer could probably make it taste nicer\u2026 But you might have to kill it first.\"  She rolled her eyes and then turned as they heard a glass being tapped repeatedly.  The room dropped to a hush, and Kyle stared, \"Is that the Headmaster? I\u2026 I never thought I'd actually see him.\"  The man standing at the end of the room, behind a long table where all the staff sat, was an impressive sight. Even if one did not know who he was, fear and surprise would grip you tight.  He didn't wear a cloak, like all staff and children, rather, he was covered in an assortment of hard red scales, knitted tightly into an impenetrable armour, as well as black stripes of leather. None of it appeared as clothes, but more as a second skin.  Headmaster Bellum Draco smiled softly, as everyone stared, and he spoke softly, but his tones rang out, not in volume, but in the soul. You felt him speak into you, rather than at you. \"Welcome, students.\"  He smiled and shrugged, \"Today was the beginning of a new year, and we are\u2026 We are blessed to have so many of you. Thousands of mages-to-be, from across the globe. Some of you have chosen to be here, and for that, we are exceedingly grateful.\" The man's expression darkened, and all the lights seemed to flicker, \"However, many of you were forced to attend, after learning things too dangerous for you to handle... At least you are not ready, yet. It is to these, and anybody who believes misbehaviour can be rewarded, that I speak now. My name means 'War Dragon', I am the only known offspring between a human and a dragon. Which leaves me as the most powerful Ventusamancer that this world has ever seen. I have never developed skill, because I have never found a match for my abilities. If this does not dissuade you, the staff here are among the most powerful and skilled mages in the known world. Blood was taken from every student as you arrived. Professor Bracken, is an incredibly skilled Aimimancer. If you run away, or prove to be excessively troublesome, rather than tracking you down or bringing you back here, I will simply order your execution, and it will be done.\"  Kyle felt a chill run down his back at those words, and the Headmaster shrugged, \"But for tonight, at least, we feast.\"  Waiters and waitresses appeared from the kitchens, moving on small enchanted wisps of air, skating through the crowds, depositing food and drinks as they went.  Kyle smiled as it appeared in front of him, \"Roast chicken. Hard to see how they could screw this up.\"  Fiona breathed in raggedly, obviously shocked by the vehemence of the Headmaster's speech, and then glanced at her food with a look of disgust, \"Seriously? More meat?\"  He glanced at her, \"Wait\u2026 You don't eat meat? Really? It's not just a stereotype?\"  Fiona glared, \"Of course it is a stereotype. It's just\u2026 Whacky flavours to me.\"  Kyle raised an eyebrow and Fiona sighed, \"Fine. Most elves are vegetarian. We kind of\u2026 See the soul that died\u2026 When we eat.\"  He winced, \"Ouch. Vitamancy has some drawbacks.\"  \"Yeah.\" Fiona shrugged, \"Thankfully it doesn't seem to be one of my talents.\"  She pierced a potato and ate it slowly, considering how few vegetables had been put on her plate. The sliced chicken breast took up the majority of the plate, and the whole thing was swamped in a thick brown gravy.  Kyle loved it.  Right up until his chicken stood up.  His fists clenched and he glared around, wincing as he heard a girl giggle behind him, \"Vitamancy also has some benefits.\"  Kyle rolled his eyes, \"Fiona, this is Abigail.\" He turned, \"Abigail, Fiona Applesilver.\"  Abigail grinned and sat down, thankfully, Kyle's chicken reverted to its natural dead and food-like state. The elf eyed her suspiciously, \"Why did they send you here? Troublemaking?\"  The brunette shrugged, \"I'm a nymph. What do people expect?\"  Fiona's jaw clenched, \"I haven't had much of a good history with\u2026 Nymphs.\"  Abigail yawned, \"Meh. I slept with an elven prince once\u2026 He was pretty good, but sort of\u2026 Dry and boring.\"  Fiona blinked, \"Nymphs actually sleep around?\"  \"No!\" Abigail yelled angrily, her skin flashing to blue scales and back to a pale white skin in a wave. She winced, \"Look, nymphs don't wait on the guy, and we're pretty forward. On top of that\u2026 We don't know how to tell lies. No idea how deception works. So\u2026 Put those together and people see us as pretty\u2026 Slutty.\"  Kyle laughed, and both girls glared at him in unison, \"What?\"  He shrugged, \"Both of you\u2026 Perfect match.\"  Abigail glared, \"Do you want me to make your mouth disappear, too?\"  Kyle smiled, \"How did that go by the way? With the snake tongue?\"  Fiona frowned, \"Snake tongue? No mouth?\"  \"One of the high-and-might bitches knocked Kyle's books onto the floor, so I made her shut up. By making her mouth disappear. Before the panic attack made her suffocate I gave her mouth back, but replaced her tongue with a snake's.\" Abigail grinned, \"It was pretty funny. Anyways, one of the professors caught me, I owned up straightaway, and he tried to fix the girl's tongue. By reversing my spell.\"  Fiona smiled, \"Which just made her go back to having no mouth, right?\"  Abigail grinned, \"This one gets it. Yeah, and he kind of freaked and gave her back the snake tongue and demanded to know how to fix her. I refused.\"  Fiona's jaw dropped, \"You told a professor 'no' to his face? You looking to get Broken?\"  Abigail rolled her eyes, \"Right. They could totally Break me. I transfigured a girl I had never met from ten feet away.\"  Fiona shook her head, \"Professor Gallagher could transfigure you into an ant from over at the staff table. You are above average, but not that impressive.\"  Abigail sighed, \"You're probably right\u2026 But\u2026 I just can't stand rules. No idea how to live under them. But, anyways\u2026 I was late to dinner because of detention.\"  Kyle frowned, \"What did you do for detention?\"  Abigail winced, \"It wasn't\u2026 Pleasant.\"  Fiona blinked, \"We're all ears. A nymph not wanting to tell?\"  The water nymph rubbed her eyes, \"Guys\u2026 Just\u2026 I'll tell you tomorrow. Just not tonight.\"  Kyle winced, feeling an odd mixture of emotion, and awkwardly patted the girl's arm. She stared at him, \"Dude. Thanks\u2026 But don't touch me again.\"  He looked at her dumbfounded and Fiona glared at him, \"Kyle. You're an Aimimancer. She's a Vitamancer. You just showed her your soul.\"  His face drained of colour, \"Damn\u2026 I am so\u2026 so\u2026 sorry\u2026\"  Abigail smiled weakly, \"It wasn't\u2026 As terrible as I thought it would be.\" She shrugged, \"Not that you aren't dark. You're nearly pitch black\u2026 I just expected a bit more insanity to you, is all.\"  \"Don't pity me.\" He said quickly, with less force than he had meant, and Abigail laughed, \"Kyle, I didn't mean it. It's just something that would take some getting used to\u2026 A Vitamancer doesn't just see your soul\u2026 They see the defining memories that colour your life. Watching a dozen people die, someone's descent into madness, or someone's greatest fears\u2026 Not something you can handle when you're as young as I am.\"  Kyle turned, \"That reminds me, Fiona, how old are you?\"  Abigail smacked him over the back of the head, \"Shut up, Kyle. She's an elf, and that's rude.\"  The water nymph winced, \"And\u2026 I'm sorry. I'm going to bed\u2026 I don't feel well.\"  Fiona frowned, \"Wait. You feel awful from Kyle and whatever evil thing detention was. Can I try and give you a cure?\"  Abigail glared, \"The stuck up soul of an elf? No thanks.\"  \"Not me.\" She smiled, \"Professor Maidr. Head of Sanamancy.\"  Abigail blinked, \"Huh. I guess that might work. Sanamancy means using your hopes and dreams to help people, right? Heal them?\"  \"It does, child.\"  Abigail froze up in fear and turned around slowly, wide-eyed, and blinked at the pixie floating behind her, who smiled sweetly, \"And you, my dear, would not do well to see my soul.\"  The water nymph nodded slowly, \"I understand, professor.\"  The pixie shrugged, scattering a twinkling of magical dust, \"But I can help you. I know what detention was tonight\u2026 A deserved punishment, I believe. But\u2026 I am not without mercy.\"  The professor flicked her fingers quickly, in a blurred motion, and a small yellow glowing ball, no bigger than an eye appeared, and she gently pushed it into Abigail's head, and into her skull.  The pixie withdrew her arm, and darted away, and Abigail grabbed her head, her elbows falling to the table, \"OMG, this really hurts.\"  Kyle frowned, \"What the hell did she do to you?\"  Fiona swallowed, \"She placed a Vault inside Abigail's head. A place that can trap unwanted memories, for a short time. The Vault collapses when you sleep next, and the memories come back. Gives you some fairly terrible nightmares.\"  Abigail smiled weakly, \"Yeah\u2026 Except I don't like forgetting things, so it's sapping my magic instead.\"  The two looked at her in concern and she stood up, \"I'm going for a swim.\"  The water nymph strode off, still holding her head, and Fiona winced, \"That was my fault\u2026 I should go after her.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Why?\"  \"Because that is what nice people do for each other, sociopath.\" Fiona growled and stood up, storming into the hall.  He scratched his head, \"What did I say?\"  \"You're an idiot.\" Came a dark growl, and Kyle spun to see the Head of Aimimancy standing over him with an angry expression, \"I heard you used Aimimancy to create your amulet today.\"  Kyle nodded slowly, \"I did.\"  \"Why?\" Came the brutally flat question, and he shrugged, \"I\u2026 I struggle to pay attention with the basics. So I skipped ahead without waiting for the professor to explain.\"  \"I repeat myself.\" Professor Bracken glared, \"You are an idiot. You may know magic, and a lot of Aimimancy. I've read some of your work, myself, and it is brilliant\u2026 But if you do not understand people, how could you ever use them? If you cannot understand people, or work with them\u2026 Then you'll be a hermit, and forgotten. To someone of your talents\u2026 Breaking you would be a pleasant alternative than the insanity that would bring on your mind.\"  Kyle cringed, \"Sorry, professor. I\u2026 I have not felt many things in my life.\"  Bracken nodded, \"I am aware. I saw you care for Abigail this evening\u2026 That was friendship you felt. Try and preserve it\u2026 If you cannot make at least one friend\u2026 How would you ever enter my School? You do have a lot you could learn from me\u2026 But a mage you will never be if you do not learn what friendship means.\"  Kyle nodded and stood, \"This is where I chase after her, and console her, correct?\"  \"Don't follow a trope.\" Bracken said with scorn, \"Be what you are.\"  Kyle sighed in confusion and walked from the hall.",

Why are you here?\"\n\n\n\"You.\"\n\n\nShe turned around slowly, \"I sent Fiona away.\"\n\n\n\"I passed her. She was crying.\" He said with a shrug, watching her with his disturbingly focused eyes, and Abigail frowned, \"So why didn't you chase the girl you met first?\"\n\n\n\"I have no idea why I'm chasing anybody.\" Kyle shrugged, \"You know that.\"\n\n\nShe rubbed her eyes, \"You are an exceedingly difficult person to know.\"\n\n\nKyle sat down on the rocks, shrugging, \"I've got to start somewhere.\"\n\n\nAbigail laughed, \"Professor Bracken sent you, right?\"\n\n\nHe smiled sheepishly, \"Yep.\"\n\n\nAbigail turned back to the water, sadness crossing her face, \"I don't like it here\u2026 I didn't actually choose to come\u2026 But my life has sucked for a long time.\"\n\n\nKyle didn't say anything, probably the wisest thing he had done since she had first met him.\n\n\nShe ran a toe in the water, blue scales flashing over her foot before her skin replaced them again, \"I'm an outsider. Like you. Not exactly surprising\u2026 But I'm a lot more than that. Reason I'm an outsider, is because I'm an orphan. Sort of\u2026 Eugh\u2026 I have no idea how to say this\u2026\"\n\n\nShe heard Kyle shift and she spun around, and blinked as she saw him sitting on the rocks, concern on his face\u2026 But also... Empathy.\n\n\n\"It was an accident?\"\n\n\nHer eyes widened, tears forming in them, \"How the hell do you know?\"\n\n\n\"Why do you think I tried so hard to revive my mother? I invented half of the principles of Aimimancy trying to work out Necromancy. I killed her\u2026 Ripped the soul from her body when I got angry. I destroyed her soul\u2026 There's no way to come back from that\u2026\" Kyle hugged his own chest and shrugged, \"I butchered the only person I ever cared about.\"\n\n\nAbigail sat down onto the sand, the waves washing across her legs, bouncing between scales and skin, and she swallowed, running a hand through her hair. \"Both\u2026 Both my\u2026 Parents\u2026 My sister too\u2026 I\u2026 I can still see them.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"What happened?\"\n\n\nAbigail through her hands into the air, tears running down her cheeks, leaving trails of blue scales, \"I don't know! I got mad, Dad hit me over the head\u2026 Mum said I was worthless\u2026 My sister was balling her eyes because she was hungry\u2026 And I\u2026 I Snapped.\"\n\n\nKyle stared at her, \"You Snapped? That's how you found magic? But\u2026 I thought all nymphs were born with magic. They don't have some wall between them and power to Snap.\"\n\n\n\"I was called worthless for a reason.\" Abigail wiped her face with her arm, leaving as streak of scales for a moment, \"Nobody believe me. They all thought I was just weird and weak.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled softly, \"I wish I could give you a hug\u2026 But instead\u2026 Can I see you?\"\n\n\nAbigail cocked her head, \"You can see me now\u2026 And how is that going to help? I feel like crap. Worse than crap.\"\n\n\n\"See you, not this mask you wear.\" He said, smiling and watching her intently, and Abigail blinked, \"Like\u2026 In the water?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah.\" Kyle gestured, \"Why don't you go swimming?\"\n\n\nAbigail rolled her eyes, \"Because the sea is full of man-eating sharks with mutant gills that excrete acidic poisons?\"\n\n\nKyle laughed and walked over to the water's edge, \"What's that against two student mages?\"\n\n\nAbigail raised an eyebrow, \"The Headmaster put them there to stop people escaping.\"\n\n\nHe frowned, and then smiled, \"Look, if I can give you a safe barrier, will you go swimming then?\"\n\n\nShe looked at him in surprise, \"Hells yeah. I really want to swim. Let myself be free.\"\n\n\nKyle grinned, \"Awesome.\"\n\n\nHe looked down and kicked around the stones, and then picked up a shell, \"You might not like to watch. This needs a fair bit of\u2026 Well\u2026 Blood.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled softly, \"I don't hate you, Kyle.\"\n\n\nHe pressed the shell against his arm, halfway between elbow and wrist, and pulled sharply down, wincing, cutting deep. The blood rose quickly, dripping downwards, but before it fell it pulled into a bubble. His face was locked in concentration, but he managed a half-smile, \"This is one of my own little inventions.\"\n\n\nThen he spread his hands, dropping the shell. The blood stretched out as a band in front of him, and Kyle spoke carefully, \"Fieri obice eligo qui tuentur. Servo Dei electus.\"\n\n\nThe blood vanished, and Abigail blinked as she felt a warmth encompass her, a calm she had never felt descended, and she frowned, \"What did you do?\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"You heard me. What did I say?\"\n\n\nAbigail scratched her head, \"Um\u2026 'Become the barrier, and protect the one that I choose. Protect the chosen one.' What does that mean?\"\n\n\nKyle grinned, \"You are protected by my life. So long as I live, and the spell lasts, no harm can come to you. At all.\"\n\n\nAbigail raised an eyebrow, \"Really?\"\n\n\n\"Chapter Seventeen, Spells of Immortality and Protection.\" He shrugged, \"It's written on my spells\u2026 Why would I lie to someone I wish to hell I could cheer up?\"\n\n\n\"Meh.\" She shrugged and jumped backwards into the water, feeling her legs combine into her tail. Her skin split and ruptured a hundred times into tiny blue scales, and her eyes misted and shifted, revealing a different spectrum of light.\n\n\nShe lay in the water, savouring the moment, and then she felt the current, and swept away.\n\n\nThe water ran over her skin, her scales flaring and channelling it over her as she swum through the water, feeling alive for the first time since she entered the School.\n\n\nShe felt the stress melting away, the fear fading.\n\n\nIt was just her, and the water.\n\n\nShe grinned, spinning as she swum upwards, and she burst into the air, flipping over backwards with a flick of her hair and tail, and she let loose a girlish burst of laughter.\n\n\nThe laughter fled as she plunged it the water again, the shark staring her in the eyes, the black holes of utter depth looking into her. Green liquid bled out from its mouth, the water boiling around it.\n\n\nFear clutched her heart, but the shark moved first, she felt its jaw close around her shoulder and she let out a scream of pain... But surprise hit her.\n\n\nIt didn't actually hurt.\n\n\nKyle's spell was holding.\n\n\nShe shoved the shark aside without fear, and swam back to the shore, a smile etched into her face.\n\n\nShe emerged dripping from the water, flashing between scales and skin, and she laughed, \"Kyle, that was... Amazing.\"\n\n\nHer eyes danced as she looked up, and her heart fell, \"What the hell happened to you?\"\n\n\nKyle was lying on the rocks, blood pouring off him, smoking burns across his forearms, his breathing ragged.\n\n\nShe swept him up into her arms, and she swallowed, fighting the visions, stumbled up the hill, making for the castle as quickly as she could.\n\n\nHis spell had protected her.\n\n\nBy passing the damage on to himself.\n\n\nKyle groaned, \"Stop. Abigail.\"\n\n\nShe ignored him, \"You're an idiot, Kyle. A damn idiot.\"\n\n\n\"And a god damned blood mage!\" He hissed and she paused, looking at him, \"You think you can heal yourself?\"\n\n\nKyle grinned, well half his mouth did, the rest drooped. She laughed and started to walk again, but he pushed out of her grip. He hit the ground, and Abigail swore.\n\n\nKyle winced, forcing himself into a sitting position, \"I passed out. Didn't expect so much acid.\"\n\n\nHe flexed his fingers, and Abigail blinked as his blood rolled off her, pooling into a two-dimensional circle in front of him. Kyle tilted it upright, looking at himself in the reflection, \"Huh... I do look a piece of work.\"\n\n\nAbigail crossed her arms, \"Yes.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed and yawned, \"Hmm... Let me see... Revertere quod ademit, haec sana corporis per me.\"\n\n\nThe blood exploded into tiny balls and slammed into his body like nails, and Kyle gasped, the air knocked out of him.\n\n\nAbigail blinked, \"Huh. You look better.\"\n\n\nHe shrugged touching his shoulder and stood up, \"The memory takes a bit to fade... But healing? That's easy for an Aimimancer. I'd say we're every bit as good as a Sanamancer.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"Umm... Didn't that hurt like balls? Sanamancers don't.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"Yeah, but I'd rather not get expelled or Broken.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled softly and tousled his hair, \"You are a right mad one... Thanks for the swim.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged his shoulders, \"Now... What exactly did you say to Fiona?\"\n\n\nAbigail looked sheepish, \"I... I... Well, it's embarrassing.\"\n\n\nKyle rolled his eyes, \"You've seen into my soul enough that touching me doesn't freak you out anymore. I think some reciprocation would be cool.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"Don't remind me. Your soul is kinda... Black... I guess... I told Fiona that elves are the garbage that trees grow when nymphs forget to look after them.\"\n\n\nKyle groaned and rubbed his head, \"Why?\"\n\n\n\"I wanted to be alone.\"\n\n\nHe sighed, looking at her with pity, \"Even I can see how badly that would go.\"\n\n\nAbigail threw her hands into the air, \"I can't lie! I'm a bloody nymph!\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Don't ask a sociopath how to get along with people. I might know what is wrong, but I have no idea what is right.\"\n\n\nAbigail sighed and ran a hand through her hair, \"Can... Can I just go for another swim?\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"If you... If you try and fix things with Fiona, I'll do it again.\"\n\n\nAbigail ground her teeth, \"Fine! I'll go and talk to the elf.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle winced at the door to the dormitory as he heard a deep voice, \"What the hell do you think you are doing out at this hour?\"\n\n\nHe turned and saw Professor Bateman, a deep glare uncharacteristically scored into his face.\n\n\nKyle winced, \"I hurt another student's feelings. I was attempting to make amends.\"\n\n\nBateman looked at him with scorn, \"Which student?\"\n\n\nKyle swallowed, \"Abigail... Uhm... I don't remember her last name.\"\n\n\nBateman broke into a smile, \"It's fine, kid. Bracken talked to me. Nice job. How'd it go?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, uncertain, \"Abigail seemed happier... But she pissed off Fiona before I got there. Badly.\"\n\n\nBateman frowned, \"How so?\"\n\n\n\"Said some nasty things about elvenkind.\" Kyle said slowly and Bateman winced, \"Well, that might blow up in our faces. Let's hope Fiona's parents don't get wind of it. They would be rather... Unhelpful.\"\n\n\nKyle managed a weak smile, then turned, intending on heading to bed, but Bateman caught his shoulder, \"Watch it with the Aimimancy, Kyle, not everyone is as understanding as me. It might get you killed.\"\n\n\nThe young student looked at the professor carefully, \"Have you noticed a threat?\"\n\n\n\"Have you noticed the hatred towards Blood Mages?\" Bateman said incredulously and shrugged, \"Flaunting your skills\u2026 Is insane. You haven't made the right friends for that. Watch your back.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed and opened the door, stepping inside the dormitory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona collapsed onto the bed, burying her head in the pillow, trying to fight back the tears.\n\n\nShe knew Abigail had been hurting... But... How could she?\n\n\nFiona let out a muffled yell of frustration.\n\n\nA series of stifled girlish giggles caught her ear, and she spun around, glaring.\n\n\nThree human girls stood there, laughing with one another. One of them, her hair black except for the fringe, tinged silver, crossed her arms, glaring, \"What's the matter elf? Nymph steal your boyfriend?\"\n\n\nFiona felt rage hit her, and she glared, \"And what would a human know? You are nothing, weak and short lived. Idiots who burn away the best of their years spreading rumours.\"\n\n\nThe girl uncrossed her arms, taking a wooden necklace from around her neck, \"Take it back.\"\n\n\nFiona sneered, and the ground began to shake, \"I'll bury you in the stone of this castle. Find another room, you piece of crap.\"\n\n\nThe girl spread her hands, tendrils of flames sprang up, encasing them, \"You want to take me on girl? Really?\"\n\n\nFiona rolled her eyes, \"Nunc igitur lapidem descendere mea ut veniat desuper.\"\n\n\nA small brick shifted and slipped, falling from the roof.\n\n\nIt thumped into the Pyromancer's head and she slumped to the ground silently.\n\n\nFiona raised an eyebrow at the other two, \"Want to pick a fight with a Terramancer in a place made of rock?\"\n\n\nThey left, dragging their compatriot.\n\n\nThe elf smiled and lay back onto the bed, looking at the ceiling, the walls of stone surrounding her, supporting her.\n\n\nShe could feel every crack, every crevasse. She could feel the mortar holding the stones in place, the magic resonance on every surface, binding it in place.\n\n\nThe stone she had made fall shook, as if dusting itself off, and floated back into place.\n\n\nFiona smiled despite herself, the Terramancer who built this place must have been impressive to see.\n\n\n\"He was.\"\n\n\nThe elf glared up, her ears quivering, turning red, \"What the hell do you want, Nymph?\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"I'm sorry. I really am.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, staring, \"Holy... Hell must have frozen over. A nymph apologized.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, fighting back tears, \"I really am sorry.\"\n\n\nFiona sighed and ran a hand through her blond hair, shimmering in the dying light, \"I guess... I can't blame you, Abigail... Detention is meant to be as bad as any torture curse.\"\n\n\nThe nymph swallowed, \"It is.\"\n\n\nFiona winced, and swung her legs over the bed, patting beside her, \"Guess we both screwed up.\"\n\n\nAbigail sat down and shrugged, \"The best of us wad a sociopath.\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, \"Kyle? What did he do?\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled, looking off distantly, \"He protected me so I could swim...\" She smiled and looked down, \"And told.me to apologise.\"\n\n\nFiona laughed, \"And who told him to do that?\"\n\n\nThe stone next to the bed warped and shifted, a face pushing up from underneath it, \"I did.\"\n\n\nBoth girls jumped with a squeal, and Abigail glared, \"You always peep on the girls' dormitory?\"\n\n\nThe face laughed, \"Nope. Just now. I wanted to check on the two of you... Kyle is an interesting individual.\"\n\n\nFiona glared, \"What do you want with Kyle, then?\"\n\n\n\"I am Professor Bracken.\" The face laughed, \"Head of Aimimancy... And I have studied the work of a student... Wouldn't you watch him? He's smarter than I am, and that is rather... Scary.\"\n\n\nFiona laughed, \"He is. He always will be.\"\n\n\nBracken nodded, \"Of course.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"Is he really destined to be an Aimimancer?\"\n\n\nBracken's stony face looked concerned, \"That may or may not be his own choice. He might find skill with another magic if he simply tried... But few who learn Aimimancy ever look for another route, because it gives you a lot more power and control than any other magic.\"\n\n\nFiona's face fell and she glared at the manifestation of the professor, \"At what cost? Is that why you're spying on us?\"\n\n\nBracken nodded gravely, \"The cost... Is sanity... I have my own bad days, and I show more caution than Kyle Kilroy has ever shown in his short life.\"\n\n\nAbigail glared, \"Professor, you want us to watch Kyle? Watch his sanity... And report it to you?\"\n\n\nThe he's shook in its fixed place, \"No. Just come to me when you get worried, and I will do everything I can to bring him back... I would never ask you to break the trust in your friendship.\"\n\n\nFiona laughed, \"So you really are half elf?\"\n\n\nBracken's face darkened, \"My heritage has little to do with my attitudes. My human mother was raped by an elvish warlord. I care little for elves. Much for students.\"\n\n\nWith that, the stone melted flat again, and the visage of the professor was gone.\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"That could have gone better.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle lay in the bed, unable to sleep.\n\n\nHe ignored the black curtains dancing in the wind, the sound as the concrete knights readjusted their weapons, standing guard over the students.\n\n\nHis thoughts were endless, and cyclical.\n\n\nHe was stuck.\n\n\nHe remembered the deaths of his parents. The agony of their screams, the blood pouring across the floor.\n\n\nThe look in their eyes as they died.\n\n\nThe transition from living to gone.\n\n\nKyle sat up, clenching his fists, anger blazing in his eyes.\n\n\nIt wasn't fair.\n\n\nHe slung his legs over the side of his bed, yanking his boots on.\n\n\nThere was a thump that made the room shake, dust falling from the ceiling.\n\n\nKyle glared at the statue in front of him, down on one knee, carrying a sharp metal sword. It stood up slowly with a sound that suggested enormous mass.\n\n\nKyle winced, spreading his hands, a small vial of glass hanging from around his neck vibrating. He'd placed a small amount of his own blood in it, just in case.\n\n\nThe soldier looked down at him, and then spoke angrily, every stone in the room reverberating with his voice, \"Kyle Kilroy, you are to report to Headmaster Bellum Draco.\"\n\n\nHe swallowed nervously, and the statue turned, walking with a heavy step that shook the walls, \"Follow.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed heavily, keeping his magic ready, and followed.\n\n\nIt wasn't a particularly long walk.\n\n\nThe path basically lead to a nearby staircase, and straight up.\n\n\nThey emerged into the air, and the knight sheathed his sword, turned and left.\n\n\nKyle glanced around, trying to be wary, but the view struck him, and he stopped.\n\n\nHe stared.\n\n\nStanding on top of a cliff, looking out over the sea, staring at the night sky.\n\n\nHe felt more alone than he ever had.\n\n\n\"That is a... Different... Response.\"\n\n\nKyle spun, blood pouring from the vial, balancing in front of his hands, ready to form a weapon of his choosing.\n\n\nThe man standing opposite him glared, and waved a hand, the blood evaporated.\n\n\nThe scaled figure shook his head and smiled softly, it wasn't a nice smile. It was the smile of someone who was stronger, and was more than willing to use that strength.",

She felt the stress melting away, the fear fading.  It was just her, and the water.  She grinned, spinning as she swum upwards, and she burst into the air, flipping over backwards with a flick of her hair and tail, and she let loose a girlish burst of laughter.  The laughter fled as she plunged it the water again, the shark staring her in the eyes, the black holes of utter depth looking into her. Green liquid bled out from its mouth, the water boiling around it.  Fear clutched her heart, but the shark moved first, she felt its jaw close around her shoulder and she let out a scream of pain... But surprise hit her.  It didn't actually hurt.  Kyle's spell was holding.  She shoved the shark aside without fear, and swam back to the shore, a smile etched into her face.  She emerged dripping from the water, flashing between scales and skin, and she laughed, \"Kyle, that was... Amazing.\"  Her eyes danced as she looked up, and her heart fell, \"What the hell happened to you?\"  Kyle was lying on the rocks, blood pouring off him, smoking burns across his forearms, his breathing ragged.  She swept him up into her arms, and she swallowed, fighting the visions, stumbled up the hill, making for the castle as quickly as she could.  His spell had protected her.  By passing the damage on to himself.  Kyle groaned, \"Stop. Abigail.\"  She ignored him, \"You're an idiot, Kyle. A damn idiot.\"  \"And a god damned blood mage!\" He hissed and she paused, looking at him, \"You think you can heal yourself?\"  Kyle grinned, well half his mouth did, the rest drooped. She laughed and started to walk again, but he pushed out of her grip. He hit the ground, and Abigail swore.  Kyle winced, forcing himself into a sitting position, \"I passed out. Didn't expect so much acid.\"  He flexed his fingers, and Abigail blinked as his blood rolled off her, pooling into a two-dimensional circle in front of him. Kyle tilted it upright, looking at himself in the reflection, \"Huh... I do look a piece of work.\"  Abigail crossed her arms, \"Yes.\"  Kyle sighed and yawned, \"Hmm... Let me see... Revertere quod ademit, haec sana corporis per me.\"  The blood exploded into tiny balls and slammed into his body like nails, and Kyle gasped, the air knocked out of him.  Abigail blinked, \"Huh. You look better.\"  He shrugged touching his shoulder and stood up, \"The memory takes a bit to fade... But healing? That's easy for an Aimimancer. I'd say we're every bit as good as a Sanamancer.\"  Abigail frowned, \"Umm... Didn't that hurt like balls? Sanamancers don't.\"  Kyle laughed, \"Yeah, but I'd rather not get expelled or Broken.\"  Abigail smiled softly and tousled his hair, \"You are a right mad one... Thanks for the swim.\"  Kyle shrugged his shoulders, \"Now... What exactly did you say to Fiona?\"  Abigail looked sheepish, \"I... I... Well, it's embarrassing.\"  Kyle rolled his eyes, \"You've seen into my soul enough that touching me doesn't freak you out anymore. I think some reciprocation would be cool.\"  Abigail winced, \"Don't remind me. Your soul is kinda... Black... I guess... I told Fiona that elves are the garbage that trees grow when nymphs forget to look after them.\"  Kyle groaned and rubbed his head, \"Why?\"  \"I wanted to be alone.\"  He sighed, looking at her with pity, \"Even I can see how badly that would go.\"  Abigail threw her hands into the air, \"I can't lie! I'm a bloody nymph!\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Don't ask a sociopath how to get along with people. I might know what is wrong, but I have no idea what is right.\"  Abigail sighed and ran a hand through her hair, \"Can... Can I just go for another swim?\"  Kyle frowned, \"If you... If you try and fix things with Fiona, I'll do it again.\"  Abigail ground her teeth, \"Fine! I'll go and talk to the elf.\"    Kyle winced at the door to the dormitory as he heard a deep voice, \"What the hell do you think you are doing out at this hour?\"  He turned and saw Professor Bateman, a deep glare uncharacteristically scored into his face.  Kyle winced, \"I hurt another student's feelings. I was attempting to make amends.\"  Bateman looked at him with scorn, \"Which student?\"  Kyle swallowed, \"Abigail... Uhm... I don't remember her last name.\"  Bateman broke into a smile, \"It's fine, kid. Bracken talked to me. Nice job. How'd it go?\"  Kyle shrugged, uncertain, \"Abigail seemed happier... But she pissed off Fiona before I got there. Badly.\"  Bateman frowned, \"How so?\"  \"Said some nasty things about elvenkind.\" Kyle said slowly and Bateman winced, \"Well, that might blow up in our faces. Let's hope Fiona's parents don't get wind of it. They would be rather... Unhelpful.\"  Kyle managed a weak smile, then turned, intending on heading to bed, but Bateman caught his shoulder, \"Watch it with the Aimimancy, Kyle, not everyone is as understanding as me. It might get you killed.\"  The young student looked at the professor carefully, \"Have you noticed a threat?\"  \"Have you noticed the hatred towards Blood Mages?\" Bateman said incredulously and shrugged, \"Flaunting your skills\u2026 Is insane. You haven't made the right friends for that. Watch your back.\"  Kyle sighed and opened the door, stepping inside the dormitory.    Fiona collapsed onto the bed, burying her head in the pillow, trying to fight back the tears.  She knew Abigail had been hurting... But... How could she?  Fiona let out a muffled yell of frustration.  A series of stifled girlish giggles caught her ear, and she spun around, glaring.  Three human girls stood there, laughing with one another. One of them, her hair black except for the fringe, tinged silver, crossed her arms, glaring, \"What's the matter elf? Nymph steal your boyfriend?\"  Fiona felt rage hit her, and she glared, \"And what would a human know? You are nothing, weak and short lived. Idiots who burn away the best of their years spreading rumours.\"  The girl uncrossed her arms, taking a wooden necklace from around her neck, \"Take it back.\"  Fiona sneered, and the ground began to shake, \"I'll bury you in the stone of this castle. Find another room, you piece of crap.\"  The girl spread her hands, tendrils of flames sprang up, encasing them, \"You want to take me on girl? Really?\"  Fiona rolled her eyes, \"Nunc igitur lapidem descendere mea ut veniat desuper.\"  A small brick shifted and slipped, falling from the roof.  It thumped into the Pyromancer's head and she slumped to the ground silently.  Fiona raised an eyebrow at the other two, \"Want to pick a fight with a Terramancer in a place made of rock?\"  They left, dragging their compatriot.  The elf smiled and lay back onto the bed, looking at the ceiling, the walls of stone surrounding her, supporting her.  She could feel every crack, every crevasse. She could feel the mortar holding the stones in place, the magic resonance on every surface, binding it in place.  The stone she had made fall shook, as if dusting itself off, and floated back into place.  Fiona smiled despite herself, the Terramancer who built this place must have been impressive to see.  \"He was.\"  The elf glared up, her ears quivering, turning red, \"What the hell do you want, Nymph?\"  Abigail winced, \"I'm sorry. I really am.\"  Fiona blinked, staring, \"Holy... Hell must have frozen over. A nymph apologized.\"  Abigail winced, fighting back tears, \"I really am sorry.\"  Fiona sighed and ran a hand through her blond hair, shimmering in the dying light, \"I guess... I can't blame you, Abigail... Detention is meant to be as bad as any torture curse.\"  The nymph swallowed, \"It is.\"  Fiona winced, and swung her legs over the bed, patting beside her, \"Guess we both screwed up.\"  Abigail sat down and shrugged, \"The best of us wad a sociopath.\"  Fiona frowned, \"Kyle? What did he do?\"  Abigail smiled, looking off distantly, \"He protected me so I could swim...\" She smiled and looked down, \"And told.me to apologise.\"  Fiona laughed, \"And who told him to do that?\"  The stone next to the bed warped and shifted, a face pushing up from underneath it, \"I did.\"  Both girls jumped with a squeal, and Abigail glared, \"You always peep on the girls' dormitory?\"  The face laughed, \"Nope. Just now. I wanted to check on the two of you... Kyle is an interesting individual.\"  Fiona glared, \"What do you want with Kyle, then?\"  \"I am Professor Bracken.\" The face laughed, \"Head of Aimimancy... And I have studied the work of a student... Wouldn't you watch him? He's smarter than I am, and that is rather... Scary.\"  Fiona laughed, \"He is. He always will be.\"  Bracken nodded, \"Of course.\"  Abigail frowned, \"Is he really destined to be an Aimimancer?\"  Bracken's stony face looked concerned, \"That may or may not be his own choice. He might find skill with another magic if he simply tried... But few who learn Aimimancy ever look for another route, because it gives you a lot more power and control than any other magic.\"  Fiona's face fell and she glared at the manifestation of the professor, \"At what cost? Is that why you're spying on us?\"  Bracken nodded gravely, \"The cost... Is sanity... I have my own bad days, and I show more caution than Kyle Kilroy has ever shown in his short life.\"  Abigail glared, \"Professor, you want us to watch Kyle? Watch his sanity... And report it to you?\"  The he's shook in its fixed place, \"No. Just come to me when you get worried, and I will do everything I can to bring him back... I would never ask you to break the trust in your friendship.\"  Fiona laughed, \"So you really are half elf?\"  Bracken's face darkened, \"My heritage has little to do with my attitudes. My human mother was raped by an elvish warlord. I care little for elves. Much for students.\"  With that, the stone melted flat again, and the visage of the professor was gone.  Abigail winced, \"That could have gone better.\"    Kyle lay in the bed, unable to sleep.  He ignored the black curtains dancing in the wind, the sound as the concrete knights readjusted their weapons, standing guard over the students.  His thoughts were endless, and cyclical.  He was stuck.  He remembered the deaths of his parents. The agony of their screams, the blood pouring across the floor.  The look in their eyes as they died.  The transition from living to gone.  Kyle sat up, clenching his fists, anger blazing in his eyes.  It wasn't fair.  He slung his legs over the side of his bed, yanking his boots on.  There was a thump that made the room shake, dust falling from the ceiling.  Kyle glared at the statue in front of him, down on one knee, carrying a sharp metal sword. It stood up slowly with a sound that suggested enormous mass.  Kyle winced, spreading his hands, a small vial of glass hanging from around his neck vibrating. He'd placed a small amount of his own blood in it, just in case.  The soldier looked down at him, and then spoke angrily, every stone in the room reverberating with his voice, \"Kyle Kilroy, you are to report to Headmaster Bellum Draco.\"  He swallowed nervously, and the statue turned, walking with a heavy step that shook the walls, \"Follow.\"  Kyle sighed heavily, keeping his magic ready, and followed.  It wasn't a particularly long walk.  The path basically lead to a nearby staircase, and straight up.  They emerged into the air, and the knight sheathed his sword, turned and left.  Kyle glanced around, trying to be wary, but the view struck him, and he stopped.  He stared.  Standing on top of a cliff, looking out over the sea, staring at the night sky.  He felt more alone than he ever had.  \"That is a... Different... Response.\"  Kyle spun, blood pouring from the vial, balancing in front of his hands, ready to form a weapon of his choosing.  The man standing opposite him glared, and waved a hand, the blood evaporated.  The scaled figure shook his head and smiled softly, it wasn't a nice smile. It was the smile of someone who was stronger, and was more than willing to use that strength.",

            "text": "Chapter Three\n\n\n\n\nBellum Draco looked at Kyle, smiling the smile of his more fiery ancestors, and the student shivered.\n\n\nKyle swallowed nervously, still feeling the sting of the loss of his magic, \"You asked for me, sir?\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster laughed, \"Not asked. Commanded.\"\n\n\nKyle winced.\n\n\nDraco shrugged, \"The knights of this castle are old, older than even I, or your friend Fiona. But they follow the rules of the School. Which means they do what I say.\" The Headmaster smiled, \"I'm telling you this, so that you widen your horizons just a little. The way you look at the world, and at unattainable power\u2026 Isn't healthy.\"\n\n\nKyle looked at the man carefully, \"Why did you send for me?\"\n\n\n\"Because you are an idiot.\" Draco growled, shaking his head, \"You flaunt your power and knowledge. You ignore all avenues open to you in magic and education. And worst, you maintain an obsession with resurrecting those killed in torture.\"\n\n\nKyle clenched his fists, \"I am not a man to be trifled with, even by you, Headmaster.\"\n\n\nDraco blinked, looking at him with disgust, \"Do you feel the breeze, Kyle?\"\n\n\nThe student frowned and shrugged, \"What of it?\"\n\n\nImmediately the shallow breeze touching his face turned into a hurricane whirlwind and he was slammed into the stonework of the roof. Kyle forced his head round and looked up, watching the wind blow passed Draco without affecting him in the least.\n\n\nThe wind dropped back to the breeze, and Draco smiled as Kyle staggered to his feet, \"I am the uncontested most powerful Ventusamancer in the world, kid. Where there is air\u2026 I have a weapon. One you will never be able to defeat in your wildest dreams, unless you wake up and pay attention to the world.\"\n\n\nKyle glared, \"Excuse me?\"\n\n\n\"Every professor is at least skilled in a secondary School of Magic to the one they teach.\" Draco said and shrugged, \"Even myself, whose primary skills are with wind and fire have enough skill to rip the blood from the grip of a renowned Aimimancer\u2026\" He sighed heavily and shook his head, \"You are renowned, Kyle\u2026 But unskilled. You have learned a lot of theory, delving to save your parents from their fates\u2026 But you haven't spread your mind far enough, even in your chosen School of Magic. Aimimancy can do a lot more than healing and fighting\u2026 With those skills you might have stopped me.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Whatever. What on earth does this have to do with me? I am what I am.\"\n\n\n\"No, you aren't.\" Draco growled and sighed, his tail flicking behind him in frustration, \"Things are\u2026 Moving. Not everything is as it appears, and you are in grave danger. I can't protect you all the time.\"\n\n\nKyle stopped, looking at the Headmaster carefully, \"Exactly how much is my life at risk? This is the second warning I've got.\"\n\n\nDraco sighed, looking at the horizon, \"I guess you deserve to know\u2026 The school was assaulted this afternoon\u2026 They were looking for you. To kill you.\"\n\n\nKyle blinked in surprise, \"Who would want to kill me? I'm just a kid. I could understand other students, maybe\u2026 But outside these walls?\"\n\n\nDraco laughed harshly, looking over at Kyle, \"Outside these walls? Outside these walls mages are butchered every day of the week! Outside these walls, most of humanity is dead. A few Elvish strongholds exist, but for the main part, the world is an icy, cold, wasteland filled with monsters looking to suck out your soul.\"\n\n\nKyle swallowed and Draco clenched his fists, \"You need to pay attention, kid. There aren't that many of us teachers around, and fewer who can teach you what you need to know. We don't just force people to train here so that they can be safely controlled, unable to harm themselves or others by accident\u2026 We prepare you for the war out there.\"\n\n\nThe young Aimimancer stood carefully, watching the Headmaster, \"Who were they? How can I stop them?\"\n\n\n\"You can't stop them.\" The Headmaster said and shrugged, \"But try not to give them any more excuses to hunt you down.\"\n\n\n\"Why are they after me!?\" Kyle yelled angrily, the ground blackening suddenly around him, and Draco blinked, \"Oh. So you do have talents outside of blood. Fascinating. As to your question\u2026 I'll tell you when you have some more\u2026 Maturity about you. Suffice it to say, they are also very interested in the torture of Professor Duke.\"\n\n\nKyle paused, thoughtful, \"They want to kill me, and torture Professor Duke? They're hunting for Necromancy. They want to know how to use it.\"\n\n\nDraco smiled, \"That's enough thinking. I would much rather you found something else to study. Preferably a magic you could defend yourself with. Pyromancy seems as good a bet as any.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster turned, his scales bursting into flames, \"That will be all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona sat down at the table, dodging a pancake thrown at her head.\n\n\nAbigail collapsed into the seat, glancing at the pancake, \"Wow. That's\u2026 Probably nicer than making you eat the thing.\"\n\n\nThe elf poked the pancakes on her own plate, \"Maybe they won't be so bad if we can drown them in something.\"\n\n\nAbigail raised an eyebrow, and Fiona smiled, \"You know\u2026 Maple syrup or something?\"\n\n\n\"Maple\u2026 Syrup?\" Abigail asked in surprise, \"Wow. Elves really are out of touch. There hasn't been any Maple Syrup in human cities since\u2026 I don't know, two hundred years ago?\"\n\n\n\"Damn.\" Fiona sighed, \"It's been longer than that since I tasted it. Miss it.\"\n\n\nAbigail's jaw dropped, \"How old are you?\"\n\n\nFiona rolled her eyes, and then glanced up, \"Kyle? You okay?\"\n\n\nThe tired man rubbed his eyes and collapsed onto the table, \"The Headmaster talked to me last night.\"\n\n\nBoth froze up and he shook his head, \"Nah. He didn't\u2026 He didn't hurt me\u2026 Just\u2026 Surprised.\"\n\n\nFiona glared, her ears quivering, \"You're hiding something important.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"Yep.\"\n\n\nAbigail rolled her eyes, \"Well? Tell us.\"\n\n\n\"Nope.\" He said and lay his head on the table, \"Wake me when it's time to head to class\u2026 What is it, anyway?\"\n\n\nFiona grinned, \"Introduction to Elemental Magics.\"\n\n\nKyle glared up, \"No dropping rocks on my head.\"\n\n\nThe elf's ears turned red, and her face fell, \"Hell. You heard about that?\"\n\n\nAbigail glanced at her, \"Half the school has. You did drop a rock on Candice Silvergate's head.\"\n\n\n\"Silvergate?\" Fiona asked in surprise, \"Holy hells\u2026 I'm dead.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed from his place lying on the table, \"Nope. Worse. Candice, from what I've heard, like to be\u2026 Malicious.\"\n\n\nShe shook her head, \"Oh, I know. My last name is Applesilver, remember?\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"Something in common?\"\n\n\n\"Applesilver is called so, because someone from the Apple family married someone from the Silver family, and their kid kept both names.\" Fiona said with a sigh, and then she shrugged, \"Another Silver, married someone from the Gate family.\"\n\n\nKyle scratched his head, \"Wouldn't you be really distantly related?\"\n\n\n\"Rivals. Feuds are never sensible.\" Fiona snapped and shrugged, \"Lots and lots of history, here.\"\n\n\nHe shrugged and sighed, \"So\u2026 Who's going to kill you? Candice? Her dad?\"\n\n\n\"Mine.\" Fiona winced and rubbed the back of her head, \"There's been a sort of\u2026 Truce.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"Oh. You broke it\u2026 So\u2026 Anything we need to know about your dad?\"\n\n\nFiona went white, \"Holy hell. If my father comes here\u2026 Oh hell.\"\n\n\nKyle looked at her carefully, \"How important is your dad?\"\n\n\nThe elf winced, her ears going white, and then her golden her shimmered, turning black, and the two stared at her. She swallowed, \"Dad? Heh\u2026 Yeah\u2026 If he turns up, we are all\u2026 Very, very dead.\"\n\n\nAbigail cocked her head, \"Dead? That sounds like awesome fun. Sounds like Professor Duke would enjoy him turning up.\"\n\n\n\"No, I wouldn't.\"\n\n\nAll three spun, surprise on their faces, the enigmatic and fairly mysterious professor smiled at them tightly, his sharp face tearing away any thoughts that he might have a shred of mercy buried in his soul.\n\n\nAbigail swallowed nervously, \"Um... Sorry, Professor. I didn't notice you.\"\n\n\nHe didn't smile, the face just stayed emotionless, and the professor spoke plainly, \"I wasn't here, then.\"\n\n\nThe Professor swept his gaze of the group with a penetrating stare, \"Ah. So this is where the talent hides, is it? All three of you have already chosen your fields of magic. Second year will be quite interesting... If you pass... Though, not one of you shares talent with the others... Except for you, Abigail, of course.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, feeling like a death threat hung over his head, \"What do you mean, professor?\"\n\n\n\"Don't.\" Abigail whispered immediately, her voice clouded with fear.\n\n\nThe professor shrugged, \"It's your secret, then... But one day very soon, you'll be required to reveal it, or one of you three will die... And I won't be able to bring them back.\"\n\n\nKyle blinked, \"Foresight, especially that specific, is incredibly rare... And isn't it Vitamancy? Your opposite?\"\n\n\nThe professor smiled, and tapped his hip where a wand lay, \"Surely you've been taught by now. I needed a friend who was a Vitamancer to help me create this. You should be more... Mindful... Kyle.\" With that last word, the professor dissolved into black mist and vanished.\n\n\nKyle let go of a breath he didn't realize he was holding, and rubbed his forehead, \"Well... That sounded like a threat.\"\n\n\n\"Dad's still scarier.\" Fiona said quickly, clearly in shock.\n\n\nAbigail just stood up quietly, and walked away. Shoulders slumped, head down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am the Professor of Aimimancy.\" The teacher at the front of the room began, \"I am Samuel Bracken.\"\n\n\nThe man shrugged, walking back and forth, \"Blood is something most of us fear, for good reason.\"\n\n\nThe professor turned, cutting his hand in front of the class, and all the students shouted in terror as they were all yanked into the air, invisible coils tightening around their throats.\n\n\nProfessor Bracken grinned, \"Now, whilst you're all just hanging there, let me give you the first introduction to Aimimancy. The nicest one you will ever get.\"\n\n\nHe spread his arms, and the ropes tightened, \"Aimimancy is a dangerous and powerful magic. It is exempt from most of the rules. Like incantations. Power limits.\"\n\n\nBracken slowly lowered his choking students back to their seats, but not quite releasing them, and he laughed, humour lighting his features, \"If any of you even attempt to use any sort of magic against me\u2026 I will rip your heart out.\"\n\n\nHe released the students and grinned, \"This, is Entrance to Aimimancy, and if you don't pass it, don't try the entrance exam.\"\n\n\nKyle rubbed his neck gently, looking up at the professor with one eyebrow raised, Bracken's face dropped back to its usual seriousness, and the professor bandaged his hand slowly, \"Now. Who can tell me the principle of what I just did? I know your heads are a little foggy, it comes from choking. You'll probably get used to that in this class.\"\n\n\nThe young student Aimimancer raised his hand tiredly, and the professor nodded, \"Yes. Somebody\u2026 Now, can anyone other than Kyle Kilroy tell me a damn thing about Aimimancy?\"\n\n\nA silence went over the room as Kyle slowly lowered his hand, and then the Professor's eyes widened in anger, and he clenched his bandaged hand, there was a hiss as all the air exited the room. Kyle yawned, cutting his wrist with a tiny blade, and a bubble of air surrounded him.\n\n\nThe Professor sighed, \"Now, there's an example of an Aimimancer's attitude. Death, pain\u2026 None of it means anything. Because the true power of magic, that flows through your veins.\"\n\n\nThe air returned to the room, and the professor grinned, \"That is lesson one. Now... Get out, before I kill you all.\"\n\n\nKyle stood up slowly, heading towards the door, but he felt a rush of wind, and a hand caught his shoulder. He turned slowly, and Professor Bracken frowned, \"Not you. You need an actual lesson. Something new.\"\n\n\nBracken vanished, reappearing at the front of the class, \"Come join me.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed, concentrating on the vial, and dispersed himself, reconstituting on the stage, \"So... You said something about new?\"\n\n\nBracken smiled softly, \"So, you know most of the finer points of... Everything. But, I've been working on a new theory.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"A new theory? What are you, a research professor?\"\n\n\nBracken grinned, \"Usually, for Aimimancy to work, you need access to blood, specifically blood that has been exposed to oxygen in some way. Blood spilt. Extracted.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"Yeah. Sort of why we need a sample of someone's blood before we can... Puppeteer them. You need a link from the inside to the out.\"\n\n\nThe professor nodded, \"Good, you see where this is going. I've developed a way to control blood, without oxygenation.\"\n\n\nKyle stared, \"Wow... What better way to ruin what little respect the other mages have for us.\"\n\n\nBracken rolled his eyes, \"You don't understand at all, do you? The attitude of the Aimimancer is that we are the ones with power. We don't care what others think, because we're stronger.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"I'm not sure that is a healthy way to look at things.\"\n\n\nBracken blinked, looking at him in confusion, \"Are you kidding? You are a student. You can outmatch most of the professors.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"Could you fight Bellum Draco?\"\n\n\nBracken blinked, \"With this new method? He would fight for me. A bodyguard... Slave.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded slowly, \"So... You really have reached that point.\"\n\n\nBracken blinked in surprise, \"Are you threatening me, Kyle?\"\n\n\nThe student winced, and then punched, blood suddenly encircling his fist, and his hand ripped through the fabric, punching through the flesh, breaking bones.\n\n\nKyle yanked his hand back, holding a still-beating heart.\n\n\nBracken groaned, and then tensed, \"I'm a blood mage. Removing my heart won't stop me.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"I know. But I have a link to inside your body. So... I'm also stronger and more powerful.\"\n\n\nBracken gasped as he collapsed to the ground, and Kyle shook his head, looking down, \"I'm currently liquefying each and every one of your organs.\"\n\n\nBracken tried to speak, and black liquid poured from his mouth, and Kyle smiled, \"Sorry... I'm keeping your brain functioning. Probably a little mean... But you went power mad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBellum crouched over the body and winced, \"We need a new Head of Aimimancy.\"\n\n\nProfessor Duke cocked his head, \"Well, we know the killer.\"\n\n\nDraco looked up at the necromancer, \"Like I care. Kyle did us a favour.\"\n\n\nThe necromancer cracked his jaw, \"Which sets things in motion. And could end up with one of our most prodigious students being murdered.\"\n\n\nBellum shrugged, \"If he can't survive a few dozen assassination attempts, then he isn't worth it.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster stood up slowly, and shook his head, \"Dispose of the body. Make sure even you can't bring him back.\"\n\n\nHe left the necromancer in the room, walking the familiar hallways, fear and anxiety eating at his mind.\n\n\nAs he passed each statue it bowed slightly, as he passed each column a small whirlwind appeared around it before vanishing.\n\n\nThe school respected him, knew who he was and what he represented.\n\n\nBut he wasn't sure who he was.\n\n\nThe coming events, which young Kyle Kilroy had set in motion tonight, were insane and nearly impossible for anyone to survive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail cocked her head, \"Who'd you kill to cover yourself in that much blood?\"\n\n\nKyle winced as he sat down, \"Professor Bracken.\"\n\n\nThe nymph looked at him with concern, \"Are you serious?\"\n\n\nKyle swallowed and nodded, \"The... He... Aimimancy is dangerous. Brings on madness.\"\n\n\nAbigail watched him carefully, \"You... Killed... A professor.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, and then flexed his fingers, the blood rolling off him into a ball, which lit into flames and vanished. He breathed in jaggedly, \"There goes any hope of learning... Anything. Draco is probably going to expel me now.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"Did you leave a signature?\"\n\n\n\"There's a necromancer on staff.\" Kyle said and rolled his eyes, \"So... Probably Breaking me tonight.\"\n\n\nAbigail touched his hand gently, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\n\"You're not going to be Broken. Or expelled.\" Fiona said, arriving looking more than a little tired, and she sat down at the table.\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"How do you know?\"\n\n\nFiona cringed, the colour running out of her hair, \"The Headmaster took my detention. Gave me that message for you.\"\n\n\nKyle's eyes widened, \"You were given detention? For the rock on the girl's head?\"\n\n\nFiona nodded shakily.\n\n\nAbigail swallowed, \"I'd hug you...\"\n\n\nFiona nodded, in a feeble sort of way, \"I understand.\"\n\n\nKyle glanced from one to the other, \"You morph a girl. You hit a girl on the head. I kill a professor... Why haven't I been given detention?\"\n\n\nAbigail glared at him, \"Don't worry. We envy you.\"\n\n\nFiona smiled weakly, \"Because you didn't break the rules, Kyle. You killed Bracken because he was a power crazy freak. Draco would have done it himself.\"\n\n\nAbigail glanced at Fiona, \"We should tell him.\"\n\n\nFiona shook her head, \"No way.\"\n\n\n\"Seriously.\" Abigail said, blue scales revealing themselves for a moment.\n\n\nFiona glared, \"He killed him. That might be a sign.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed, \"Draco talked with me in person the other night. Told me people had attacked the school, looking to kill me.\"\n\n\nAbigail stared, \"Okay... That might be a sign.\"\n\n\nFiona winced, \"Bracken told us to watch you. Make sure you weren't going crazy.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"Heh... No he didn't.\"\n\n\nAbigail blinked, \"Yes, he did.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed and stretched out a hand, muttering. The ground changed shape, revealing the face of Bracken.\n\n\nFiona glared, \"You spied on the girl dorm?\"\n\n\nKyle let it drop, and shook his head, \"Nope. But Bracken sucked with Terramancy. I guessed the rest.\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, \"So... Who?\"\n\n\nHe shrugged.",

            "text": "Bellum Draco looked at Kyle, smiling the smile of his more fiery ancestors, and the student shivered.  Kyle swallowed nervously, still feeling the sting of the loss of his magic, \"You asked for me, sir?\"  The Headmaster laughed, \"Not asked. Commanded.\"  Kyle winced.  Draco shrugged, \"The knights of this castle are old, older than even I, or your friend Fiona. But they follow the rules of the School. Which means they do what I say.\" The Headmaster smiled, \"I'm telling you this, so that you widen your horizons just a little. The way you look at the world, and at unattainable power\u2026 Isn't healthy.\"  Kyle looked at the man carefully, \"Why did you send for me?\"  \"Because you are an idiot.\" Draco growled, shaking his head, \"You flaunt your power and knowledge. You ignore all avenues open to you in magic and education. And worst, you maintain an obsession with resurrecting those killed in torture.\"  Kyle clenched his fists, \"I am not a man to be trifled with, even by you, Headmaster.\"  Draco blinked, looking at him with disgust, \"Do you feel the breeze, Kyle?\"  The student frowned and shrugged, \"What of it?\"  Immediately the shallow breeze touching his face turned into a hurricane whirlwind and he was slammed into the stonework of the roof. Kyle forced his head round and looked up, watching the wind blow passed Draco without affecting him in the least.  The wind dropped back to the breeze, and Draco smiled as Kyle staggered to his feet, \"I am the uncontested most powerful Ventusamancer in the world, kid. Where there is air\u2026 I have a weapon. One you will never be able to defeat in your wildest dreams, unless you wake up and pay attention to the world.\"  Kyle glared, \"Excuse me?\"  \"Every professor is at least skilled in a secondary School of Magic to the one they teach.\" Draco said and shrugged, \"Even myself, whose primary skills are with wind and fire have enough skill to rip the blood from the grip of a renowned Aimimancer\u2026\" He sighed heavily and shook his head, \"You are renowned, Kyle\u2026 But unskilled. You have learned a lot of theory, delving to save your parents from their fates\u2026 But you haven't spread your mind far enough, even in your chosen School of Magic. Aimimancy can do a lot more than healing and fighting\u2026 With those skills you might have stopped me.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Whatever. What on earth does this have to do with me? I am what I am.\"  \"No, you aren't.\" Draco growled and sighed, his tail flicking behind him in frustration, \"Things are\u2026 Moving. Not everything is as it appears, and you are in grave danger. I can't protect you all the time.\"  Kyle stopped, looking at the Headmaster carefully, \"Exactly how much is my life at risk? This is the second warning I've got.\"  Draco sighed, looking at the horizon, \"I guess you deserve to know\u2026 The school was assaulted this afternoon\u2026 They were looking for you. To kill you.\"  Kyle blinked in surprise, \"Who would want to kill me? I'm just a kid. I could understand other students, maybe\u2026 But outside these walls?\"  Draco laughed harshly, looking over at Kyle, \"Outside these walls? Outside these walls mages are butchered every day of the week! Outside these walls, most of humanity is dead. A few Elvish strongholds exist, but for the main part, the world is an icy, cold, wasteland filled with monsters looking to suck out your soul.\"  Kyle swallowed and Draco clenched his fists, \"You need to pay attention, kid. There aren't that many of us teachers around, and fewer who can teach you what you need to know. We don't just force people to train here so that they can be safely controlled, unable to harm themselves or others by accident\u2026 We prepare you for the war out there.\"  The young Aimimancer stood carefully, watching the Headmaster, \"Who were they? How can I stop them?\"  \"You can't stop them.\" The Headmaster said and shrugged, \"But try not to give them any more excuses to hunt you down.\"  \"Why are they after me!?\" Kyle yelled angrily, the ground blackening suddenly around him, and Draco blinked, \"Oh. So you do have talents outside of blood. Fascinating. As to your question\u2026 I'll tell you when you have some more\u2026 Maturity about you. Suffice it to say, they are also very interested in the torture of Professor Duke.\"  Kyle paused, thoughtful, \"They want to kill me, and torture Professor Duke? They're hunting for Necromancy. They want to know how to use it.\"  Draco smiled, \"That's enough thinking. I would much rather you found something else to study. Preferably a magic you could defend yourself with. Pyromancy seems as good a bet as any.\"  The Headmaster turned, his scales bursting into flames, \"That will be all.\"    Fiona sat down at the table, dodging a pancake thrown at her head.  Abigail collapsed into the seat, glancing at the pancake, \"Wow. That's\u2026 Probably nicer than making you eat the thing.\"  The elf poked the pancakes on her own plate, \"Maybe they won't be so bad if we can drown them in something.\"  Abigail raised an eyebrow, and Fiona smiled, \"You know\u2026 Maple syrup or something?\"  \"Maple\u2026 Syrup?\" Abigail asked in surprise, \"Wow. Elves really are out of touch. There hasn't been any Maple Syrup in human cities since\u2026 I don't know, two hundred years ago?\"  \"Damn.\" Fiona sighed, \"It's been longer than that since I tasted it. Miss it.\"  Abigail's jaw dropped, \"How old are you?\"  Fiona rolled her eyes, and then glanced up, \"Kyle? You okay?\"  The tired man rubbed his eyes and collapsed onto the table, \"The Headmaster talked to me last night.\"  Both froze up and he shook his head, \"Nah. He didn't\u2026 He didn't hurt me\u2026 Just\u2026 Surprised.\"  Fiona glared, her ears quivering, \"You're hiding something important.\"  Kyle nodded, \"Yep.\"  Abigail rolled her eyes, \"Well? Tell us.\"  \"Nope.\" He said and lay his head on the table, \"Wake me when it's time to head to class\u2026 What is it, anyway?\"  Fiona grinned, \"Introduction to Elemental Magics.\"  Kyle glared up, \"No dropping rocks on my head.\"  The elf's ears turned red, and her face fell, \"Hell. You heard about that?\"  Abigail glanced at her, \"Half the school has. You did drop a rock on Candice Silvergate's head.\"  \"Silvergate?\" Fiona asked in surprise, \"Holy hells\u2026 I'm dead.\"  Kyle laughed from his place lying on the table, \"Nope. Worse. Candice, from what I've heard, like to be\u2026 Malicious.\"  She shook her head, \"Oh, I know. My last name is Applesilver, remember?\"  Abigail frowned, \"Something in common?\"  \"Applesilver is called so, because someone from the Apple family married someone from the Silver family, and their kid kept both names.\" Fiona said with a sigh, and then she shrugged, \"Another Silver, married someone from the Gate family.\"  Kyle scratched his head, \"Wouldn't you be really distantly related?\"  \"Rivals. Feuds are never sensible.\" Fiona snapped and shrugged, \"Lots and lots of history, here.\"  He shrugged and sighed, \"So\u2026 Who's going to kill you? Candice? Her dad?\"  \"Mine.\" Fiona winced and rubbed the back of her head, \"There's been a sort of\u2026 Truce.\"  Abigail winced, \"Oh. You broke it\u2026 So\u2026 Anything we need to know about your dad?\"  Fiona went white, \"Holy hell. If my father comes here\u2026 Oh hell.\"  Kyle looked at her carefully, \"How important is your dad?\"  The elf winced, her ears going white, and then her golden her shimmered, turning black, and the two stared at her. She swallowed, \"Dad? Heh\u2026 Yeah\u2026 If he turns up, we are all\u2026 Very, very dead.\"  Abigail cocked her head, \"Dead? That sounds like awesome fun. Sounds like Professor Duke would enjoy him turning up.\"  \"No, I wouldn't.\"  All three spun, surprise on their faces, the enigmatic and fairly mysterious professor smiled at them tightly, his sharp face tearing away any thoughts that he might have a shred of mercy buried in his soul.  Abigail swallowed nervously, \"Um... Sorry, Professor. I didn't notice you.\"  He didn't smile, the face just stayed emotionless, and the professor spoke plainly, \"I wasn't here, then.\"  The Professor swept his gaze of the group with a penetrating stare, \"Ah. So this is where the talent hides, is it? All three of you have already chosen your fields of magic. Second year will be quite interesting... If you pass... Though, not one of you shares talent with the others... Except for you, Abigail, of course.\"  Kyle frowned, feeling like a death threat hung over his head, \"What do you mean, professor?\"  \"Don't.\" Abigail whispered immediately, her voice clouded with fear.  The professor shrugged, \"It's your secret, then... But one day very soon, you'll be required to reveal it, or one of you three will die... And I won't be able to bring them back.\"  Kyle blinked, \"Foresight, especially that specific, is incredibly rare... And isn't it Vitamancy? Your opposite?\"  The professor smiled, and tapped his hip where a wand lay, \"Surely you've been taught by now. I needed a friend who was a Vitamancer to help me create this. You should be more... Mindful... Kyle.\" With that last word, the professor dissolved into black mist and vanished.  Kyle let go of a breath he didn't realize he was holding, and rubbed his forehead, \"Well... That sounded like a threat.\"  \"Dad's still scarier.\" Fiona said quickly, clearly in shock.  Abigail just stood up quietly, and walked away. Shoulders slumped, head down.    \"I am the Professor of Aimimancy.\" The teacher at the front of the room began, \"I am Samuel Bracken.\"  The man shrugged, walking back and forth, \"Blood is something most of us fear, for good reason.\"  The professor turned, cutting his hand in front of the class, and all the students shouted in terror as they were all yanked into the air, invisible coils tightening around their throats.  Professor Bracken grinned, \"Now, whilst you're all just hanging there, let me give you the first introduction to Aimimancy. The nicest one you will ever get.\"  He spread his arms, and the ropes tightened, \"Aimimancy is a dangerous and powerful magic. It is exempt from most of the rules. Like incantations. Power limits.\"  Bracken slowly lowered his choking students back to their seats, but not quite releasing them, and he laughed, humour lighting his features, \"If any of you even attempt to use any sort of magic against me\u2026 I will rip your heart out.\"  He released the students and grinned, \"This, is Entrance to Aimimancy, and if you don't pass it, don't try the entrance exam.\"  Kyle rubbed his neck gently, looking up at the professor with one eyebrow raised, Bracken's face dropped back to its usual seriousness, and the professor bandaged his hand slowly, \"Now. Who can tell me the principle of what I just did? I know your heads are a little foggy, it comes from choking. You'll probably get used to that in this class.\"  The young student Aimimancer raised his hand tiredly, and the professor nodded, \"Yes. Somebody\u2026 Now, can anyone other than Kyle Kilroy tell me a damn thing about Aimimancy?\"  A silence went over the room as Kyle slowly lowered his hand, and then the Professor's eyes widened in anger, and he clenched his bandaged hand, there was a hiss as all the air exited the room. Kyle yawned, cutting his wrist with a tiny blade, and a bubble of air surrounded him.  The Professor sighed, \"Now, there's an example of an Aimimancer's attitude. Death, pain\u2026 None of it means anything. Because the true power of magic, that flows through your veins.\"  The air returned to the room, and the professor grinned, \"That is lesson one. Now... Get out, before I kill you all.\"  Kyle stood up slowly, heading towards the door, but he felt a rush of wind, and a hand caught his shoulder. He turned slowly, and Professor Bracken frowned, \"Not you. You need an actual lesson. Something new.\"  Bracken vanished, reappearing at the front of the class, \"Come join me.\"  Kyle sighed, concentrating on the vial, and dispersed himself, reconstituting on the stage, \"So... You said something about new?\"  Bracken smiled softly, \"So, you know most of the finer points of... Everything. But, I've been working on a new theory.\"  Kyle frowned, \"A new theory? What are you, a research professor?\"  Bracken grinned, \"Usually, for Aimimancy to work, you need access to blood, specifically blood that has been exposed to oxygen in some way. Blood spilt. Extracted.\"  Kyle frowned, \"Yeah. Sort of why we need a sample of someone's blood before we can... Puppeteer them. You need a link from the inside to the out.\"  The professor nodded, \"Good, you see where this is going. I've developed a way to control blood, without oxygenation.\"  Kyle stared, \"Wow... What better way to ruin what little respect the other mages have for us.\"  Bracken rolled his eyes, \"You don't understand at all, do you? The attitude of the Aimimancer is that we are the ones with power. We don't care what others think, because we're stronger.\"  Kyle frowned, \"I'm not sure that is a healthy way to look at things.\"  Bracken blinked, looking at him in confusion, \"Are you kidding? You are a student. You can outmatch most of the professors.\"  Kyle laughed, \"Could you fight Bellum Draco?\"  Bracken blinked, \"With this new method? He would fight for me. A bodyguard... Slave.\"  Kyle nodded slowly, \"So... You really have reached that point.\"  Bracken blinked in surprise, \"Are you threatening me, Kyle?\"  The student winced, and then punched, blood suddenly encircling his fist, and his hand ripped through the fabric, punching through the flesh, breaking bones.  Kyle yanked his hand back, holding a still-beating heart.  Bracken groaned, and then tensed, \"I'm a blood mage. Removing my heart won't stop me.\"  Kyle nodded, \"I know. But I have a link to inside your body. So... I'm also stronger and more powerful.\"  Bracken gasped as he collapsed to the ground, and Kyle shook his head, looking down, \"I'm currently liquefying each and every one of your organs.\"  Bracken tried to speak, and black liquid poured from his mouth, and Kyle smiled, \"Sorry... I'm keeping your brain functioning. Probably a little mean... But you went power mad.\"    Bellum crouched over the body and winced, \"We need a new Head of Aimimancy.\"  Professor Duke cocked his head, \"Well, we know the killer.\"  Draco looked up at the necromancer, \"Like I care. Kyle did us a favour.\"  The necromancer cracked his jaw, \"Which sets things in motion. And could end up with one of our most prodigious students being murdered.\"  Bellum shrugged, \"If he can't survive a few dozen assassination attempts, then he isn't worth it.\"  The Headmaster stood up slowly, and shook his head, \"Dispose of the body. Make sure even you can't bring him back.\"  He left the necromancer in the room, walking the familiar hallways, fear and anxiety eating at his mind.  As he passed each statue it bowed slightly, as he passed each column a small whirlwind appeared around it before vanishing.  The school respected him, knew who he was and what he represented.  But he wasn't sure who he was.  The coming events, which young Kyle Kilroy had set in motion tonight, were insane and nearly impossible for anyone to survive.    Abigail cocked her head, \"Who'd you kill to cover yourself in that much blood?\"  Kyle winced as he sat down, \"Professor Bracken.\"  The nymph looked at him with concern, \"Are you serious?\"  Kyle swallowed and nodded, \"The... He... Aimimancy is dangerous. Brings on madness.\"  Abigail watched him carefully, \"You... Killed... A professor.\"  Kyle nodded, and then flexed his fingers, the blood rolling off him into a ball, which lit into flames and vanished. He breathed in jaggedly, \"There goes any hope of learning... Anything. Draco is probably going to expel me now.\"  Abigail frowned, \"Did you leave a signature?\"  \"There's a necromancer on staff.\" Kyle said and rolled his eyes, \"So... Probably Breaking me tonight.\"  Abigail touched his hand gently, \"I'm sorry.\"  \"You're not going to be Broken. Or expelled.\" Fiona said, arriving looking more than a little tired, and she sat down at the table.  Kyle frowned, \"How do you know?\"  Fiona cringed, the colour running out of her hair, \"The Headmaster took my detention. Gave me that message for you.\"  Kyle's eyes widened, \"You were given detention? For the rock on the girl's head?\"  Fiona nodded shakily.  Abigail swallowed, \"I'd hug you...\"  Fiona nodded, in a feeble sort of way, \"I understand.\"  Kyle glanced from one to the other, \"You morph a girl. You hit a girl on the head. I kill a professor... Why haven't I been given detention?\"  Abigail glared at him, \"Don't worry. We envy you.\"  Fiona smiled weakly, \"Because you didn't break the rules, Kyle. You killed Bracken because he was a power crazy freak. Draco would have done it himself.\"  Abigail glanced at Fiona, \"We should tell him.\"  Fiona shook her head, \"No way.\"  \"Seriously.\" Abigail said, blue scales revealing themselves for a moment.  Fiona glared, \"He killed him. That might be a sign.\"  Kyle sighed, \"Draco talked with me in person the other night. Told me people had attacked the school, looking to kill me.\"  Abigail stared, \"Okay... That might be a sign.\"  Fiona winced, \"Bracken told us to watch you. Make sure you weren't going crazy.\"  Kyle frowned, \"Heh... No he didn't.\"  Abigail blinked, \"Yes, he did.\"  Kyle sighed and stretched out a hand, muttering. The ground changed shape, revealing the face of Bracken.  Fiona glared, \"You spied on the girl dorm?\"  Kyle let it drop, and shook his head, \"Nope. But Bracken sucked with Terramancy. I guessed the rest.\"  Fiona frowned, \"So... Who?\"  He shrugged.",

            "text": "Chapter Four\n\n\n\n\nFiona dashed into the classroom, breathing a sigh of relief. No teacher in sight. Just a clay statue at the front of the room.\n\n\nShe dove into a seat and flicked open her textbook.\n\n\nIt immediately slammed shut.\n\n\nShe stared at the front of the room, and noticed the wooden staff in the statue's hand and winced. \"Please don't give me detention.\"\n\n\nThe statue creaked, the mouth opening slightly, revealing an intense golden light, \"I am Professor Adrian Burke. Head of Terramancy. I am a golem, rigid and unbending.\"\n\n\nFear wrote itself into her face, and the professor looked down at her, \"Show me the spell for creating a golem, and your tardiness will be forgiven.\"\n\n\nFiona felt a chill run down her. It was one of the most advanced spells out. And it required more than just Terramancy.\n\n\nShe stood, concentrating, breathing in, \"\u00c6difica corpus animam in lapide en tenere me.\"\n\n\nStone rose up, forming a skeleton, and the professor nodded slowly, \"And the soul?\"\n\n\nShe winced, \"Vitamancy is not one of my skills.\"\n\n\nThe professor shrugged, \"Then detention it is.\"\n\n\nShe burst into tears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail yawned as Professor Bateman yammered on about the dangerous nature of fire, and how a Pyromancer is always right on the edge of dying.\n\n\nNone of it made a lot of sense to her. Animating objects, creating life, controlling the living. That made sense.\n\n\n\"To delve into the magic of Pyromancy, you must be the void, and your thoughts the flame.\" Bateman said earnestly, and Abigail struggled to contain a yawn.\n\n\n\"Eight words to make a spell, yes.\" Bateman continued, smiling, his eyes glowing, \"But without the right thoughts and attitudes, it will fail on you. A practiced practitioner... They are always in the right mindset for their most skilled magic. It's why we only teach you one type after first year. Once you get sorted into the appropriate School, it becomes harder to learn or even use any other kind of magic.\"\n\n\nAbigail cocked her head, raising her hand, and he nodded, \"Yes, Miss Ignis?\"\n\n\nShe shrugged, \"Can't most of the professors use two magics? At least?\"\n\n\nBateman smiled, \"Good question. Nice to see you are paying a small amount of attention to this class. That is true - but not for most people. In fact, for most of the professors, knowing two magics was never their goal.\" He scratched his jagged and unkempt brown beard, \"For example... The Headmaster. Most skilled Wind Mage in the entire world. So you would expect he has studied Ventusamancy his whole life. You would be wrong. He was a Pyromancer, when in his last year at this school, he accidentally awoke his dragon heritage. It forced the new magic on him. So he is incredibly gifted with both.\"\n\n\nAbigail blinked, that was news.\n\n\nSo... Could another professor had faked being Bracken?\n\n\nOr was it really Kyle?\n\n\nThe third option still stood, of course. It had been Bracken.\n\n\nWhat was so important about Kyle?\n\n\nAimimancers came and went.\n\n\nWas he really that much smarter than the rest?\n\n\nAbigail slowly realized that Bateman was still talking to her.\n\n\n\"Miss Ignis!\" The professor growled, \"Because this class is so easy for you, would you please create an Elemental for me?\"\n\n\nShe winced, \"I can bring it to life. I can't form the body.\"\n\n\n\"Detention.\"\n\n\nVisions slammed into her and she winced, tossing her fear forward, crying as she muttered the words.\n\n\nSparks formed over her fingers for a moment.\n\n\nShe clenched her eyes shut, trying to force the flame forward, guide the possibility out of the realm of power that was magic.\n\n\n\"Stop!\" Bateman roared, but she was desperate.\n\n\nShe could not go to detention again.\n\n\nSomething stung her cheek, incredibly painful, and she opened her eyes to see Bateman glaring down at her, \"I would rather you did not kill us all. Pyromancy needs the Void, Miss Ignis. You banned from this class, from this day forth. Never try and make a flame that way... Ever.\"\n\n\nShe swallowed, fighting the tears threatening to overwhelm her, \"What did I do?\"\n\n\n\"You almost summoned a vampire.\" Bateman whispered, terror in his voice, but she could feel the isolation around them. He hadn't let anyone else hear.\n\n\nHe walked back towards the front, the spell fading, \"It's still detention.\"\n\n\nDetention again, and expelled from a class.\n\n\nHer future looked bleak - they'd torture her, and then Break her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle gritted his teeth, trying as hard as he could.\n\n\nFor Terramancy to work, he had to be in a secure, focused state. He had to be solid, without doubt, without fear.\n\n\nAround the girls earlier, he had shown off, he had been certain. Stronger than any metal.\n\n\nNow, with Professor Burke, staring down at him, with the gold glow from his mouth, and Fiona balling her eyes out in the background?\n\n\nHe was useless.\n\n\nThe professor sighed heavily, \"Come now, the spell to turn wood to stone is not that complex.\"\n\n\nKyle swallowed, \"Sorry, I'm just better with... Things that bleed.\"\n\n\nThe golem let out a slow sound of disgust, followed by one dark word.\n\n\n\"Detention.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle sat, feeling an unusual amount of fear.\n\n\nIt was dark, the hallways were almost quiet, apart from the occasional statue moving, only the breathing of the five students waiting for detention sounded out.\n\n\nFiona and Abigail refused to talk at all.\n\n\nSo he sat and waited.\n\n\nIt was painful.\n\n\nHe was not a man who liked to sit still. All this waiting, in trepidation of utter chaos, evil no one wanted to talk about.\n\n\nLone footsteps echoed in the corridor, and he stood up, \"Finally.\"\n\n\nThe professor who emerged was a living tree. Green sprouts, twigs, all of it twisting into a root-like structure, shaped like a man. He wore a black cloak, inscribed with dozens of silver sigils. All of them appeared to be bones or depictions of death.\n\n\nThe professor's voice was deep, making the soul reverberate inside Kyle's body. \"Sit down, Mr. Kilroy.\"\n\n\nKyle sat down slowly, wincing in fear.\n\n\nThe Professor of Necromancy looked at the group slowly, \"Detention is only given to those who both break the rules of the School in a way we don't like and have skill with magic.\"\n\n\nProfessor Duke nodded, \"There is a good reason for this.\"\n\n\nThe black-cloaked figure pointed to the wall, \"Outside, lie many dangers. Ones that particularly target magic users. They wish to tear us down, and remove the little protection most places have. We are the protectors, that is our role. If you mean to rule\u2026 Nature will destroy you soon enough.\"\n\n\nHe walked forward, \"For your detention, you will assist me in guarding these walls. I would compel you not to tell your fellow students\u2026 But the fear you will face usually is enough. Trauma is a good way to keep secrets, at times.\"\n\n\nKyle's jaw tensed, and the Dryad looked over at him, \"Yes, I am aware that some of those who assault this fortress are looking for you. Whether they wish to kill or capture you is still to be seen.\"\n\n\nFiona glanced up, \"Someone is hunting Kyle?\"\n\n\n\"They sent the four dragons you had to destroy last time you were summoned for detention.\" The professor shrugged, \"As well as a couple hundred obsessive humans, a tribe of elves, a dozen nymphs and about seven thousand golems. All in the last week.\"\n\n\nKyle swallowed, a chill running down his back. He didn't understand it.\n\n\nAll this... For him?\n\n\n\"I am seriously not that important.\"\n\n\nThe professor glared, \"Yet, it seems someone thinks you are. As such, I will be accompanying all students for their detention tonight. That is not the norm. If you die on detention... So be it. You broke the rules.\"\n\n\nHe raised his hands, and the wall shook, vibrating so quickly it seemed to almost become a window.\n\n\nKyle winced, out of phase. \n\n\nHe stood up, using his mind to grip onto the blood around him, and he stepped through the wall.\n\n\nHe could feel the others following him, but his eyes were fixed on the horizon.\n\n\nThe entire mountain range seemed to be alight, akin to a bushfire, yet he knew they were campsites.\n\n\nThere had to be millions.\n\n\nHe winced, \"That's an army.\"\n\n\nA wooden grouping of roots, vaguely resembling a hand, gripped his shoulder, \"Indeed. They number seven million, six hundred thousand, two hundred and eighty two souls... But not all of those will be soldiers. There will be generals, tacticians, cooks and cleaners, administration, and so on.\"\n\n\nKyle felt a bead of sweat form on his head, \"Will they all attack tonight? And how good at Vitamancy are you, still?\"\n\n\nThe Professor laughed, \"Yes, I was a Vitamancer before I became a Necromancer... And that is how I know their numbers, but as to the attack? They could. So far, they have been testing our defences, trying to find a weakness. They may be ready, or they might try a feint, or even another test. It is difficult to tell.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"You have got to teach me that trick about not being afraid.\"\n\n\n\"It comes with being a Necromancer.\" Professor Duke said quietly, calmly. \"Death means nothing to me. I have died over a thousand times.\"\n\n\nKyle glanced at him in surprise, \"Then why do you even let the army attack? Even all together they couldn't stop you, could they?\"\n\n\nThe Dryad shrugged, \"I am unsure. They might actually be able to stop me... But I doubt it... They key however, is understanding why they want you.\"\n\n\nKyle tensed, spotting shadows on the horizon, \"I guess we are about to find out.\"\n\n\n\"I doubt it.\" Duke said and yawned, \"Those are vampires. Crazier creatures do not exist. Mad with hunger, they would never be able to follow an order concerning a specific individual.\"\n\n\nKyle cringed, preparing a protection spell, \"Vampires?\"\n\n\nThe professor laughed, and spoke in a loud voice so the others would hear, \"Ignore the vampires. They're mine. Look down though, there's a troll or three coming up the hill.\"\n\n\nKyle glared down through the darkness, he cast a quick spell, letting him see heat signatures for a moment, and winced, they were cold-blooded.\n\n\nHe finished his protection spell, turning his skin to stone, and glanced around, spotting his friends.\n\n\nFiona was wearing the body of a golem, boulders floated behind her, but fear was etched into every feature of her face.\n\n\nAbigail wore a look of concentration, and was binding grass around a stick, whispering incantations.\n\n\nKyle's face took on a look of abject confusion, \"What the hell are you doing?\"\n\n\nShe ignored him, standing up, \"Professor Duke. A hand?\"\n\n\nThe Dryad glanced over and smiled, \"Ah. Clever... It's done.\"\n\n\nAbigail grinned and glared down at the dark, ignoring Kyle.\n\n\nHe understood though, she'd made a wand, so she didn't need to say incantations aloud. Her spells would be faster, so she might stay alive.\n\n\nKyle glared down into the dark, and twisted the little remaining power in his grasp, causing the hillside to tremor slightly, dislodging a hail of stones downwards.\n\n\nA section, or series of sections, stopped the rocks in their tracks.\n\n\nFiona immediately launched a flurry of boulders towards all three targets, nearly yelling her incantations.\n\n\nKyle swallowed nervously, they were all on edge, and that wasn't going to help.\n\n\nWaiting here to be attacked... It wasn't his style.\n\n\nKyle grinned and leaped forward, running down the hill, as he heard yells of protest behind him.\n\n\nThe professor's voice was not among them.\n\n\nHe closed on the first troll, a giant lumbering creature of stone, standing four or maybe even five times as tall as Kyle, dragging a tree behind it as a weapon. Its eyes were a reflectionless black, and every muscle in its body bulged.\n\n\nKyle leapt, punching hard before it could react, breaking the nose.\n\n\nThe troll roared in anger, and the tree slammed into him, shattering the armour he'd forged, and breaking bones in his chest.\n\n\nKyle slammed into the ground, struggling to breathe, but he smiled and pulled.\n\n\nThe small thread of blood leaking from the troll snaked down and around its throat, pulling tight.\n\n\nThe head toppled off backwards and the body slumped forward onto the ground.\n\n\nKyle stood, realigning his bones, and drawing all the blood from the troll's body.\n\n\nHe glared around in the dark, feeling the overwhelming power in his hands, and he struck out, landing a spearing blow to the closest troll, ripping open the chest, and he proceeded to rip out its heart.\n\n\nHe pooled the blood, forming a bubble around himself and rose into the air.\n\n\nHe twisted against the fabric of reality, pushing his will hard, and the sliver of silver in the sky that was the moon sprang to life, illuminating the world.\n\n\nHe wished he hadn't.\n\n\nA hundred elves in full armour stood at the bottom of the hill, spears in hand.\n\n\nThe last troll let out a sound of anguish and collapsed, the life drained from it.\n\n\nYet, far above the elves, circling them as wardens, flew more crows than Kyle could hope to count, even as an estimation.\n\n\nHe growled, clenching his fists, and hundreds of thousands of needles shot forth from his bubble, striking into the army of elves waiting.\n\n\nSome fell with screams, but the rest failed to react at all.\n\n\nKyle glanced over at the professor, swallowing as he saw the Dryad kill the last of the flickering shadows dancing around him with a flick of a wrist.\n\n\nHe looked at Kyle, their eyes meeting, \"The attack is tonight.\"\n\n\nKyle turned back, \"Then let's alert the school.\"\n\n\n\"No need.\" Professor Duke said, striding forward, \"You may be intelligent, Kyle the Aimimancer, but you are yet to learn what power is.\"\n\n\nHe stared at the professor in fear, and he glared back at the hillside, \"What now?\"\n\n\nThe Dryad spoke loudly, magically projecting his voice, \"Send forth an emissary, or I will destroy you all. Amongst the camps as well.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, feeling the truth in the words, and an elf stepped up from the ranks slowly, and Professor Duke smiled, \"Some common courtesy, at last. Why are you attempting so feebly to attack this school?\"\n\n\nThe elf shrugged, beneath his black armour, \"I have been sent. I do not know.\"\n\n\nThe Dryad paused, \"Who is it that sent you?\"\n\n\n\"King Applesilver.\"\n\n\nFiona gasped, her concentration broke, tumbling the boulders to the ground, as the body of stone around her turned to dirt and fell away.\n\n\nKyle looked at her, \"Don't move, Fiona.\"\n\n\nShe glared at him, \"I'm not suicidal, Kyle.\"\n\n\nThe elf laughed, \"Princess Applesilver! I hoped to send a message to you. Your father wishes to tell you that you are hereby vanished from all Elven lands, strongholds and towns.\"\n\n\nFiona winced, fighting back emotions.\n\n\nKyle tinged the moon slightly darker, \"Why would King Applesilver send you to die?\"\n\n\nThe elf looked at him, suspended in the air, and shook his head, \"Because of you, Kyle Kilroy. He wants you destroyed.\"\n\n\nKyle clenched his fists, \"Why?\"\n\n\n\"Aimimancy is an abomination!\" The elf yelled angrily, spitting on the ground. He pointed a finger, \"You and this Necromancer are dark blights on the world. It cannot be saved until you and your kind are extinct.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled sadly, remembering his awakening of Aimimancy, \"Elf, so long as there is sorrow and loss, blood magic will be found.\"\n\n\nProfessor Duke sighed and spread his hands, \"Enough. There will be no attack. Return to King Applesilver and tell him this is a fool's errand.\"\n\n\nThe elf turned to go, and then spun, shouting and throwing his spear, \"Charge!\"\n\n\nKyle stared as every soldier in front of him collapsed dead before they could take a single step.\n\n\nBut he missed the spear.\n\n\nIt glided forward, unheeded, and slipped cleanly through the red liquid, plunging into Kyle's abdomen as if it were made from nothing more substantial than honey.",

            "text": "Fiona dashed into the classroom, breathing a sigh of relief. No teacher in sight. Just a clay statue at the front of the room.  She dove into a seat and flicked open her textbook.  It immediately slammed shut.  She stared at the front of the room, and noticed the wooden staff in the statue's hand and winced. \"Please don't give me detention.\"  The statue creaked, the mouth opening slightly, revealing an intense golden light, \"I am Professor Adrian Burke. Head of Terramancy. I am a golem, rigid and unbending.\"  Fear wrote itself into her face, and the professor looked down at her, \"Show me the spell for creating a golem, and your tardiness will be forgiven.\"  Fiona felt a chill run down her. It was one of the most advanced spells out. And it required more than just Terramancy.  She stood, concentrating, breathing in, \"\u00c6difica corpus animam in lapide en tenere me.\"  Stone rose up, forming a skeleton, and the professor nodded slowly, \"And the soul?\"  She winced, \"Vitamancy is not one of my skills.\"  The professor shrugged, \"Then detention it is.\"  She burst into tears.    Abigail yawned as Professor Bateman yammered on about the dangerous nature of fire, and how a Pyromancer is always right on the edge of dying.  None of it made a lot of sense to her. Animating objects, creating life, controlling the living. That made sense.  \"To delve into the magic of Pyromancy, you must be the void, and your thoughts the flame.\" Bateman said earnestly, and Abigail struggled to contain a yawn.  \"Eight words to make a spell, yes.\" Bateman continued, smiling, his eyes glowing, \"But without the right thoughts and attitudes, it will fail on you. A practiced practitioner... They are always in the right mindset for their most skilled magic. It's why we only teach you one type after first year. Once you get sorted into the appropriate School, it becomes harder to learn or even use any other kind of magic.\"  Abigail cocked her head, raising her hand, and he nodded, \"Yes, Miss Ignis?\"  She shrugged, \"Can't most of the professors use two magics? At least?\"  Bateman smiled, \"Good question. Nice to see you are paying a small amount of attention to this class. That is true - but not for most people. In fact, for most of the professors, knowing two magics was never their goal.\" He scratched his jagged and unkempt brown beard, \"For example... The Headmaster. Most skilled Wind Mage in the entire world. So you would expect he has studied Ventusamancy his whole life. You would be wrong. He was a Pyromancer, when in his last year at this school, he accidentally awoke his dragon heritage. It forced the new magic on him. So he is incredibly gifted with both.\"  Abigail blinked, that was news.  So... Could another professor had faked being Bracken?  Or was it really Kyle?  The third option still stood, of course. It had been Bracken.  What was so important about Kyle?  Aimimancers came and went.  Was he really that much smarter than the rest?  Abigail slowly realized that Bateman was still talking to her.  \"Miss Ignis!\" The professor growled, \"Because this class is so easy for you, would you please create an Elemental for me?\"  She winced, \"I can bring it to life. I can't form the body.\"  \"Detention.\"  Visions slammed into her and she winced, tossing her fear forward, crying as she muttered the words.  Sparks formed over her fingers for a moment.  She clenched her eyes shut, trying to force the flame forward, guide the possibility out of the realm of power that was magic.  \"Stop!\" Bateman roared, but she was desperate.  She could not go to detention again.  Something stung her cheek, incredibly painful, and she opened her eyes to see Bateman glaring down at her, \"I would rather you did not kill us all. Pyromancy needs the Void, Miss Ignis. You banned from this class, from this day forth. Never try and make a flame that way... Ever.\"  She swallowed, fighting the tears threatening to overwhelm her, \"What did I do?\"  \"You almost summoned a vampire.\" Bateman whispered, terror in his voice, but she could feel the isolation around them. He hadn't let anyone else hear.  He walked back towards the front, the spell fading, \"It's still detention.\"  Detention again, and expelled from a class.  Her future looked bleak - they'd torture her, and then Break her.    Kyle gritted his teeth, trying as hard as he could.  For Terramancy to work, he had to be in a secure, focused state. He had to be solid, without doubt, without fear.  Around the girls earlier, he had shown off, he had been certain. Stronger than any metal.  Now, with Professor Burke, staring down at him, with the gold glow from his mouth, and Fiona balling her eyes out in the background?  He was useless.  The professor sighed heavily, \"Come now, the spell to turn wood to stone is not that complex.\"  Kyle swallowed, \"Sorry, I'm just better with... Things that bleed.\"  The golem let out a slow sound of disgust, followed by one dark word.  \"Detention.\"    Kyle sat, feeling an unusual amount of fear.  It was dark, the hallways were almost quiet, apart from the occasional statue moving, only the breathing of the five students waiting for detention sounded out.  Fiona and Abigail refused to talk at all.  So he sat and waited.  It was painful.  He was not a man who liked to sit still. All this waiting, in trepidation of utter chaos, evil no one wanted to talk about.  Lone footsteps echoed in the corridor, and he stood up, \"Finally.\"  The professor who emerged was a living tree. Green sprouts, twigs, all of it twisting into a root-like structure, shaped like a man. He wore a black cloak, inscribed with dozens of silver sigils. All of them appeared to be bones or depictions of death.  The professor's voice was deep, making the soul reverberate inside Kyle's body. \"Sit down, Mr. Kilroy.\"  Kyle sat down slowly, wincing in fear.  The Professor of Necromancy looked at the group slowly, \"Detention is only given to those who both break the rules of the School in a way we don't like and have skill with magic.\"  Professor Duke nodded, \"There is a good reason for this.\"  The black-cloaked figure pointed to the wall, \"Outside, lie many dangers. Ones that particularly target magic users. They wish to tear us down, and remove the little protection most places have. We are the protectors, that is our role. If you mean to rule\u2026 Nature will destroy you soon enough.\"  He walked forward, \"For your detention, you will assist me in guarding these walls. I would compel you not to tell your fellow students\u2026 But the fear you will face usually is enough. Trauma is a good way to keep secrets, at times.\"  Kyle's jaw tensed, and the Dryad looked over at him, \"Yes, I am aware that some of those who assault this fortress are looking for you. Whether they wish to kill or capture you is still to be seen.\"  Fiona glanced up, \"Someone is hunting Kyle?\"  \"They sent the four dragons you had to destroy last time you were summoned for detention.\" The professor shrugged, \"As well as a couple hundred obsessive humans, a tribe of elves, a dozen nymphs and about seven thousand golems. All in the last week.\"  Kyle swallowed, a chill running down his back. He didn't understand it.  All this... For him?  \"I am seriously not that important.\"  The professor glared, \"Yet, it seems someone thinks you are. As such, I will be accompanying all students for their detention tonight. That is not the norm. If you die on detention... So be it. You broke the rules.\"  He raised his hands, and the wall shook, vibrating so quickly it seemed to almost become a window.  Kyle winced, out of phase.   He stood up, using his mind to grip onto the blood around him, and he stepped through the wall.  He could feel the others following him, but his eyes were fixed on the horizon.  The entire mountain range seemed to be alight, akin to a bushfire, yet he knew they were campsites.  There had to be millions.  He winced, \"That's an army.\"  A wooden grouping of roots, vaguely resembling a hand, gripped his shoulder, \"Indeed. They number seven million, six hundred thousand, two hundred and eighty two souls... But not all of those will be soldiers. There will be generals, tacticians, cooks and cleaners, administration, and so on.\"  Kyle felt a bead of sweat form on his head, \"Will they all attack tonight? And how good at Vitamancy are you, still?\"  The Professor laughed, \"Yes, I was a Vitamancer before I became a Necromancer... And that is how I know their numbers, but as to the attack? They could. So far, they have been testing our defences, trying to find a weakness. They may be ready, or they might try a feint, or even another test. It is difficult to tell.\"  Kyle winced, \"You have got to teach me that trick about not being afraid.\"  \"It comes with being a Necromancer.\" Professor Duke said quietly, calmly. \"Death means nothing to me. I have died over a thousand times.\"  Kyle glanced at him in surprise, \"Then why do you even let the army attack? Even all together they couldn't stop you, could they?\"  The Dryad shrugged, \"I am unsure. They might actually be able to stop me... But I doubt it... They key however, is understanding why they want you.\"  Kyle tensed, spotting shadows on the horizon, \"I guess we are about to find out.\"  \"I doubt it.\" Duke said and yawned, \"Those are vampires. Crazier creatures do not exist. Mad with hunger, they would never be able to follow an order concerning a specific individual.\"  Kyle cringed, preparing a protection spell, \"Vampires?\"  The professor laughed, and spoke in a loud voice so the others would hear, \"Ignore the vampires. They're mine. Look down though, there's a troll or three coming up the hill.\"  Kyle glared down through the darkness, he cast a quick spell, letting him see heat signatures for a moment, and winced, they were cold-blooded.  He finished his protection spell, turning his skin to stone, and glanced around, spotting his friends.  Fiona was wearing the body of a golem, boulders floated behind her, but fear was etched into every feature of her face.  Abigail wore a look of concentration, and was binding grass around a stick, whispering incantations.  Kyle's face took on a look of abject confusion, \"What the hell are you doing?\"  She ignored him, standing up, \"Professor Duke. A hand?\"  The Dryad glanced over and smiled, \"Ah. Clever... It's done.\"  Abigail grinned and glared down at the dark, ignoring Kyle.  He understood though, she'd made a wand, so she didn't need to say incantations aloud. Her spells would be faster, so she might stay alive.  Kyle glared down into the dark, and twisted the little remaining power in his grasp, causing the hillside to tremor slightly, dislodging a hail of stones downwards.  A section, or series of sections, stopped the rocks in their tracks.  Fiona immediately launched a flurry of boulders towards all three targets, nearly yelling her incantations.  Kyle swallowed nervously, they were all on edge, and that wasn't going to help.  Waiting here to be attacked... It wasn't his style.

The head toppled off backwards and the body slumped forward onto the ground.  Kyle stood, realigning his bones, and drawing all the blood from the troll's body.  He glared around in the dark, feeling the overwhelming power in his hands, and he struck out, landing a spearing blow to the closest troll, ripping open the chest, and he proceeded to rip out its heart.  He pooled the blood, forming a bubble around himself and rose into the air.  He twisted against the fabric of reality, pushing his will hard, and the sliver of silver in the sky that was the moon sprang to life, illuminating the world.  He wished he hadn't.  A hundred elves in full armour stood at the bottom of the hill, spears in hand.  The last troll let out a sound of anguish and collapsed, the life drained from it.  Yet, far above the elves, circling them as wardens, flew more crows than Kyle could hope to count, even as an estimation.  He growled, clenching his fists, and hundreds of thousands of needles shot forth from his bubble, striking into the army of elves waiting.  Some fell with screams, but the rest failed to react at all.

            "text": "Chapter Five\n\n\n\n\nKyle let loose an earth wrenching scream of agony and sat up.\n\n\nHe groaned and went to hold his chest, but his arm passed through.\n\n\nKyle launched to his feet and spun.\n\n\nHe was looking down at himself, a golden spear embedded in his stomach, icy crystalline lines spreading out from it, even up to and inside his eyes.\n\n\nKyle's jaw tightened, \"Oh hell.\"\n\n\nA nearby voice burst out laughing, \"Oh no. It seems you died.\"\n\n\nHe turned, blinking as he saw something that resembled a man, but covered in black fur.\n\n\nThe figure waved a hand, \"Hey newbie.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed, \"Why am I not surprised that the school is haunted by ghosts?\"\n\n\nThe man shook his head, standing up straight, \"No others. Just me. Takes a lot of power not to die. Takes a lot of instinct too. How good an Aimimancer were you?\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"One of the world's best... Why did I forget the spear?\"\n\n\nThe ghost rolled his eyes, \"I wouldn't blame yourself. Spear was seriously enchanted. Thinking it was both hexed to turn someone's blood to ice, but also to be unnoticeable when not in contact with flesh.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed, \"So... Now what? I accidentally stopped myself from dying all the way... So now I'm stuck?\"\n\n\nThe ghost laughed, \"Basically... I'm one of the school's founders. Only one person other than you even knows I still exist. Not a nice guy, once you get to know him... Seriously bad news.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"Professor Duke. Necromancer.\"\n\n\nThe ghost nodded, \"That'd be the one. He managed to die in some accident, turned himself into a ghost. Spent a measly hundred years haunting the school and managed to resurrect himself.\"\n\n\nKyle felt it click and he smiled, \"To become a Necromancer... You first have to bring yourself back to life?\"\n\n\nThe ghost nodded, \"Yep. Till then... You can't interact with a damn thing... Or leave... You find a door outside, but it'll feel like a stone wall to you. Wherever your body is, you're bound to it.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"You didn't know you could resurrect yourself, did you?\"\n\n\nThe ghost shook his head, \"Nope... And my body has long since turned to dust. I'm not even bound to the school anymore... So I can never come back.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed heavily, looking at his body, \"So, I need to heal my body, then find my binding to it, break that binding and then create a new one before I die.\"\n\n\nThe ghost started, \"Damn! Took Duke seventy years to work that out!\"\n\n\nKyle smiled and looked back at the ghost, \"I've devoted basically my whole life to the study of Necromancy. I'm only a brilliant Aimimancer because I want to know Necromancy.\"\n\n\nThe ghost shrugged, \"I and Duke used Vitamancy to get stuck here.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled and turned, \"My name is Kyle Kilroy. If we're stuck here for a while...\"\n\n\n\"Wes Anderson.\" The ghost said, mock bowing, \"You should find Duke. He might be an asshole, but he was concerned when he couldn't just resurrect you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Duke was sitting behind a text, gently turning the pages of a book. The pages were black, with embroidered golden text, in a language which was half imagery, half symbols that Kyle had never seen.\n\n\nHe spoke quietly, \"Is that Dryadic?\"\n\n\nDuke sighed, \"No. That language is almost lost. This... This language has long been lost to time.\"\n\n\nThe professor looked up sadly, \"So, you have become a Necromancer, just as you dreamed.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"Being a ghost sucks. When people walk through you... It's... Gross.\"\n\n\nDuke managed the smallest of smiles, \"Indeed... But your situation is not great. You may have noticed that your magical ability is somewhat... Tarnished.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"I have no blood, so no Aimimancy for me.\"\n\n\n\"No any-mancy.\" Duke sighed and shrugged, \"You are stuck, the only magic you can possibly use is Necromancy.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"So what now? How do I rebind myself to my body?\"\n\n\nDuke looked at him, and shrugged, \"You may know that to be the solution, which is impressive... But I can't help you until you resurrect yourself, Kyle.\"\n\n\nThe student looked at the professor with concern, \"What do you mean? You are the only Necromancer alive! If you can't help... What the hell does that mean?\"\n\n\nDuke shook his head, \"Teaching Necromancy... I don't know... Here's an example. Describe the colour blue to me.\"\n\n\nKyle blinked, \"Blue? It's a light colour. Between red and green on the colour spectrum.\"\n\n\nDuke laughed, \"Yes... But tell me what it looks like.\"\n\n\nKyle opened his mouth, paused and shrugged, \"No idea. You have to see it.\"\n\n\n\"Precisely.\" Duke said and smiled, \"To be a Necromancer, you must first already know Necromancy. It's next to impossible to describe.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed, \"So I'm stuck here, with only you and Wes.\"\n\n\nDuke's face darkened, \"Never trust Wes Anderson. There's a reason they burned his body before he could bring himself back.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, running a hand through his hair, \"So, I'm stuck between a ghost and a professor, in the land of nobody knows I'm alive.\"\n\n\nDuke shrugged, \"Pretty much. I will let Fiona and Abigail know you are alive, if you wish.\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"I'll tell them myself. Soon.\"\n\n\nDuke laughed and went back to his book.\n\n\nKyle walked through the professor's door, more than a little frustrated and annoyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona sat down at the table quietly, looking at the lunch meal in front of her.\n\n\nShe could feel Abigail watching her, but she couldn't do it.\n\n\nShe couldn't talk.\n\n\nNot after what happened.\n\n\nShe just... Couldn't.\n\n\nIt was too much, hurt like hell.\n\n\nShe wasn't empty, that would have been a blessing. Instead she felt, and it was... Too much.\n\n\nAbigail spoke anyway, \"You okay, Fi? After your dad turning up like that?\"\n\n\nShe looked up in surprise, \"Dad?\"\n\n\nThe water nymph looked positively depressed, her scales showing through her skin, large bags beneath her eyes. Her shoulders were slumped, and the colour had faded from her hair.\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"It was his army.\"\n\n\nThe elf looked down, fighting back tears, \"Fuck him. I don't give a shit.\"\n\n\nAbigail visibly cringed, and then she whispered, \"Fi, you want to get out of here. Candice and her groupies are coming over.\"\n\n\nFiona rubbed her eyes, \"Why? Why can't she just leave me alone?\"\n\n\n\"Hey, elf.\" Came a bright voice, but she pronounced 'elf' like one might pronounce 'dirt' or 'dust' when you become overly tired of cleaning.\n\n\nFiona ground her teeth together, grey creeping into her usually blonde hair, \"What do you want, Candice?\"\n\n\nThe girl looked at the plate in front of Fiona, \"You actually got the kitchens to serve a salad. Awesome. I'll take it.\"\n\n\n\"Get lost, Candice.\" Abigail growled, the girl jerked her head, glaring, \"Shut up, nymph. This has nothing to do with you or your kind.\"\n\n\nAbigail stood up, her fists clenching, \"Don't push me. Last night sucked.\"\n\n\nCandice laughed, \"Oh yeah. You two had detention... Say, where's your boyfriend? Still having nightmares?\"\n\n\nFiona's ears flashed red, and she glared up at the other girl, \"Kyle was killed.\"\n\n\nCandice burst out laughing, \"Poor little elf. No Blood Mage to protect her anymore.\"\n\n\nFiona felt a tear slip out of the corner of one of her eyes, and she trembled. It took everything in her not to thrash the girl to death.\n\n\nThen the table started vibrating.\n\n\nCandice looked at it, \"Seriously elf? You going to throw a table at me?\"\n\n\nFiona looked at it with concern, \"That's not Terramancy.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"I'm not doing that either.\"\n\n\nThen there was a loud sound as Candice was sent flying, and the table was where she had been.\n\n\nFiona stared as she saw a man standing there, angry as hell, and then he was gone.\n\n\nShe looked over at Abigail, \"Did you...?\"\n\n\nThe nymph was wide eyed, \"Was that...?\"\n\n\nThe two looked at each other, smiling, and Abigail laughed, \"Thanks, Kyle.\"\n\n\nThere was no response, but the two felt hope again.\n\n\nThey'd seen him, if for a moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle punched the air.\n\n\n\"I did something!\" He felt like dancing, but seeing his two friends there, with tears in their eyes, sobered him up quickly.\n\n\nHe sighed and looked at the table.\n\n\nMoving it had taken a lot of effort, but it hadn't moved normally. He'd grabbed it, or tried hard to, and then tried to throw it, but it had only moved a couple feet, and then he had become intangible again.\n\n\nBut when he was moving the table, he'd moved fast enough that the people around him had almost seemed to not move at all.\n\n\nThe result was that the force of the table hitting Candice had launched her halfway across the room and through a stone wall.\n\n\nOne of the professors was taking her to the nurse via stretcher.\n\n\nKyle frowned, thinking.\n\n\nHe was in the process of discovering a new magic, one he knew ignored the normal rules of reality.\n\n\nYet he knew, it wouldn't actually ignore the rules, they were simply more complex than most people understood them to be.\n\n\nHe knew that in physics, entangled particles were open to manipulation through observation, whether that observation happened before or after the event. Time was a malleable concept.\n\n\nAltering the flow at which time affected some particles would not be beyond reason.\n\n\nHighly unusual for a magic, however.\n\n\nNecromancy was like Vitamancy, in that it allowed the binding of life force and locations, but it could return the vital essence that was life, where once there was none.\n\n\nThe key word, was return.\n\n\nKyle smiled slowly, one of the key concepts for Necromancy had to be time, it's nature and how it affected objects individually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Maidr fluttered her tiny wings in frustration as she looked down at the young girl in her care.\n\n\nShe glanced over at the Dryad standing nearby, \"What happened to her?\"\n\n\nDuke smiled softly, \"She picked a fight with Fiona Applesilver and Abigail Ignis after the death of Kyle Kilroy.\"\n\n\nMaidr frowned, \"Fiona flung her through a wall?\"\n\n\n\"Kyle did.\" Duke replied with a grin, the professor examining the girl, \"He flung a table at her. Not with much force, mind you.\"\n\n\nMaidr blinked, \"Not much force?\"\n\n\n\"He displaced her.\" Duke shrugged, his roots creaking, \"He altered the flow of time, displaced her, and allowed the timeline to snap back into place. The latent energy was exerted onto her.\"\n\n\nMaidr swallowed, shaking her head, \"So, Kyle really is haunting the school?\"\n\n\n\"He's attempting to bring himself back.\" Duke said and frowned, \"If there was ever another who could fluke the way into becoming a Necromancer... It's Kilroy. He's nothing short of a genius.\"\n\n\nMaidr sighed, \"Genius or not, he killed her.\"\n\n\nDuke nodded gravely, \"Indeed he did. He struck her down. I have brought her back... The healing of this fragile body, I leave in your capable hands.\"\n\n\nMaidr swallowed, \"Aren't there consequences from dying?\"\n\n\n\"She will need to be informed, yes.\" Duke said and his brow crinkled, a strange thing on something made from bark, \"I am not certain she will be able to survive the consequences.\"\n\n\nMaidr stared down at the young girl and drew a small wand, made from the feather of a phoenix, and began to chant as she realigned bones, knitted muscles back together, and stretched skin back into shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona sat in her chair, yawning tiredly.\n\n\nIt was a struggle.\n\n\nShe didn't know what to think.\n\n\nWas Kyle really still alive?\n\n\nWas he stuck as a ghost? Or was he going to resurrect himself?\n\n\nDid he even want to come back?\n\n\nShe didn't know.\n\n\nIt wasn't like she had been that close to him, but in the short time she had known him, he had astounded her.\n\n\nFirst with his cynicism and knowledge...\n\n\nBut the night he died...\n\n\nFiona shivered.\n\n\nShe'd never seen so much power in one place.\n\n\nDuke had been terrifying, killing all of the elves in one moment, but Kyle had been stronger.\n\n\nA student, an orphan boy less than a quarter of her age, had somehow managed to twist the fabric of reality around her.\n\n\nHe had used magic like a poet might use words.\n\n\nFiona blushed.\n\n\nShe knew what she had felt in that moment, and it wasn't admiration, it was something deeper she hadn't quite seen coming.\n\n\nSure, he was cute in a ragged sort of way, and he was always incredibly down to earth...\n\n\n\"Miss Applesilver.\" Professor Bateman spoke harshly, and her head jerked up, \"Sorry, professor.\"\n\n\nBateman glared, \"Do you truly need a third bout of detention?\"\n\n\nShivers shot down her spine, as the memories washed over her.\n\n\nThen she saw the spear, drifting forwards, slamming into Kyle.\n\n\nShe heard him scream, the bubble of blood he had formed exploded, turning into a shrapnel bomb that destroyed the landscape around them.\n\n\nShe felt a wrench of magic as the darts stopped in front of her, falling to the ground.\n\n\nAmidst the dirt and ash she saw Kyle lying on his back, a spear through his chest, icicles creeping out across it.\n\n\nTears formed in her eyes, something that elves rarely felt.\n\n\nShe looked at Bateman through misty eyes, his stern face, and she stood quietly, and left the room.\n\n\nShe stood in the hallway, leaning her head against the cool stone, when a hand gently touched her shoulder.\n\n\nShe spun around, blinking.\n\n\nThe corridor was empty.\n\n\nAs she looked back and forth, wondering, Bateman emerged from the classroom, \"I know you've been through a lot... But so you really want to be broken, Fiona?\"\n\n\nShe swallowed, \"Professor, did you see anyone else, out here?\"\n\n\nBateman winced, \"He's keeping an eye on you, then?\"\n\n\nFiona stared, \"So Kyle really isn't dead then?\"\n\n\nThe professor shook his head, \"Kyle is absolutely dead... Well, not absolutely. But he is dead. He just found a way to stop from crossing over.\"\n\n\nFiona stared, \"Why do you say that like it isn't a good thing?\"\n\n\nBateman sighed and rubbed his face, \"If Kyle manages to come back, he'll be a Necromancer. Probably also one of the most powerful mages this world has ever seen. It will justify everything that your father is afraid of.\"\n\n\nFiona winced, \"Why would he be watching over me?\"\n\n\n\"He was your friend, Fiona.\" Bateman said, incredulous, and she shrugged, \"He liked Aby more. It was my father who ordered his death. I should have been able to save him.\"\n\n\nBateman blinked in surprise, \"Are you kidding? He hung out with you. The boy who had never had friends and killed a professor without a thought. The man who had as much prowess with magic as I do. He chose to hang out with you. You weren't a hanger-on. You were his friend.\"\n\n\nHer ears turned pink and she smiled, \"I'm sorry, professor.\"\n\n\nBateman shrugged, \"You're dealing with some trauma. It's not exactly a surprise... Take the rest of the day off. Mourn Kyle. He may never come back. And if he gets stuck... He can't leave here.\"\n\n\nFiona smiled gratefully, \"Thank you, professor.\"\n\n\nShe turned and walked down the hall, feeling like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders.\n\n\nBut the guilt was still there.\n\n\nShe had seen the spear, why hadn't she stopped it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail sat in the girl's bathroom, her hands immersed into a sink full of water.\n\n\nIt didn't compare to swimming in the least, but it was as close as she could get.\n\n\nShe probably should have been in class, but as excited as Bateman got, he was incredibly boring.\n\n\nThe water around her hands bubbled, and she jerked back in shock, staring at it.\n\n\nShe stared at the reflection on the surface, which sat still, despite the liquid seemingly boiling underneath.\n\n\nShe could see herself clearly, the lines where she had been crying, the scars from Kyle's explosion when he died. She could see her scales and skin, her ragged hair she had neglected to brush.\n\n\nBut she could also see a black haired boy behind her, smiling sadly.\n\n\nShe turned slowly, wincing as she saw the room was empty.\n\n\nShe turned back to the sink, smiling as she saw Kyle.\n\n\nTears ran freely down her cheeks, \"Can you hear me?\"\n\n\nHe nodded, smiling, and then his face took on a look of concentration, the bubbles in the sink increasing, and he spoke, his voice like a distant echo, surrounded by the hissing roar of static, \"I can hear you, Abigail.\"\n\n\nShe swallowed, \"Damn... I'm sorry, Kyle.\"\n\n\nAgain his voice seemed to come and go, accompanied by a roar of static, \"For what? I was the one dumb enough to get killed.\"\n\n\nShe wiped a tear from her cheek, \"I could have saved you.\"\n\n\n\"Do I look like I need saving?\" He growled and then he sighed, \"Nobody could have saved me. The spear was enchanted. Untouchable, until it found its target.\"\n\n\nAbigail hugged herself, \"So... What now?\"\n\n\n\"You've got a guardian angel.\" He said, but Abigail could barely hear him, the static almost drowning him out.\n\n\nShe smiled sadly, \"I miss you, Kyle.\"\n\n\n\"Me... Too...\" He shouted, and the he was gone.\n\n\nThe bubbles vanished and Abigail burst into heavier tears, leaning on the sink, \"Damn it... I miss you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona sat outside, on a rooftop, staring at the pale white mountains.\n\n\nSome camp fires still burned, but most of the army had left.\n\n\nWord had got around about Kyle's death.\n\n\n... Death.\n\n\nFiona ran her hands over her face. It was ridiculous. She didn't know whether she was supposed to mourn Kyle, or attempt to save him.\n\n\nHe was dead, but he wasn't gone.\n\n\nShe had no clue what to do.\n\n\nShe was older than most at the school, she had been to, and graduated, from three other magical colleges. She had been one of the Black Knights, warrior mages that protected the Elven King.\n\n\nShe had fought vampires, warlocks and natural events.\n\n\nBut this?\n\n\nNothing had prepared her for... This.\n\n\n\"I am so sorry, Kyle.\" She said, tears welling in her eyes, \"I don't know whether to move on, or wait for you... This is tearing me apart.\"\n\n\nNothing happened.\n\n\nIt hurt.\n\n\nShe bent her knees to her chest, hung her head, and burst into tears.\n\n\nHe was gone.\n\n\nHe was taking her heart with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBellum Draco stood atop the highest peak of the castle, his tail wrapped around a spire for support, and he looked out from his vantage point.\n\n\nHe could see the individual soldiers walking around the campfires, he could see them sharpening their weapons, donning their armour. Preparing for war.\n\n\nHe sighed heavily, he knew what they wanted.\n\n\nKyle Kilroy was not gone.\n\n\nOnly dead.\n\n\nThey would besiege the castle until he handed over Kilroy's body for destruction, or the castle fell.\n\n\nEither way.\n\n\nA difficult choice lay at his feet.\n\n\nThe potential for death and destruction was enormous.\n\n\nKill Kyle Kilroy, trapping the potentially most powerful and skilled mage in all of human history as a ghost.\n\n\nTake the College of History and Magic to war with the last of the Elven Kingdoms, fighting the darkest and most numerous army of shadowy souls called up from the depths.\n\n\nHe sighed, he needed to call a Board meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail couldn't sleep.\n\n\nShe tossed and turned, but everything seemed less comfortable.\n\n\nEventually she sat up, sweeping her sweat-matted hair behind her, and opened the window, looking out.\n\n\nShe frowned as she saw fireballs dancing in the distance.\n\n\nThe school was under attack again.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nKyle died.\n\n\nShe heard Kyle's voice echo beside her, \"They know.\"\n\n\nShe spun, staring at the vibrating mass of colour standing in her room, and swallowed, \"Kyle?\"\n\n\n\"They're coming to stop me. Abigail, you can't let them. If I die, so does the school.\" He seemed to choke up, and then he was gone.\n\n\nAbigail spun and sprinted into the hallway, and a stone statue immediately stepped down, spinning to face her, a spear in hand, \"What is your business?\"\n\n\nShe blinked as the whole hallway shook, and glared, \"I need to speak to the Headmaster.\"\n\n\nThe statue stood up slowly, but didn't lower the spear, \"For what reason?\"\n\n\n\"Kyle Kilroy, and the war that's about to happen.\"\n\n\nThe statue turned, \"Follow.\"",

            "text": "Kyle let loose an earth wrenching scream of agony and sat up.  He groaned and went to hold his chest, but his arm passed through.  Kyle launched to his feet and spun.  He was looking down at himself, a golden spear embedded in his stomach, icy crystalline lines spreading out from it, even up to and inside his eyes.  Kyle's jaw tightened, \"Oh hell.\"  A nearby voice burst out laughing, \"Oh no. It seems you died.\"  He turned, blinking as he saw something that resembled a man, but covered in black fur.  The figure waved a hand, \"Hey newbie.\"  Kyle sighed, \"Why am I not surprised that the school is haunted by ghosts?\"  The man shook his head, standing up straight, \"No others. Just me. Takes a lot of power not to die. Takes a lot of instinct too. How good an Aimimancer were you?\"  Kyle winced, \"One of the world's best... Why did I forget the spear?\"  The ghost rolled his eyes, \"I wouldn't blame yourself. Spear was seriously enchanted. Thinking it was both hexed to turn someone's blood to ice, but also to be unnoticeable when not in contact with flesh.\"  Kyle sighed, \"So... Now what? I accidentally stopped myself from dying all the way... So now I'm stuck?\"  The ghost laughed, \"Basically... I'm one of the school's founders. Only one person other than you even knows I still exist. Not a nice guy, once you get to know him... Seriously bad news.\"  Kyle smiled, \"Professor Duke. Necromancer.\"  The ghost nodded, \"That'd be the one. He managed to die in some accident, turned himself into a ghost. Spent a measly hundred years haunting the school and managed to resurrect himself.\"  Kyle felt it click and he smiled, \"To become a Necromancer... You first have to bring yourself back to life?\"  The ghost nodded, \"Yep. Till then... You can't interact with a damn thing... Or leave... You find a door outside, but it'll feel like a stone wall to you. Wherever your body is, you're bound to it.\"  Kyle frowned, \"You didn't know you could resurrect yourself, did you?\"  The ghost shook his head, \"Nope... And my body has long since turned to dust. I'm not even bound to the school anymore... So I can never come back.\"  Kyle sighed heavily, looking at his body, \"So, I need to heal my body, then find my binding to it, break that binding and then create a new one before I die.\"  The ghost started, \"Damn! Took Duke seventy years to work that out!\"  Kyle smiled and looked back at the ghost, \"I've devoted basically my whole life to the study of Necromancy. I'm only a brilliant Aimimancer because I want to know Necromancy.\"  The ghost shrugged, \"I and Duke used Vitamancy to get stuck here.\"  Kyle smiled and turned, \"My name is Kyle Kilroy. If we're stuck here for a while...\"  \"Wes Anderson.\" The ghost said, mock bowing, \"You should find Duke. He might be an asshole, but he was concerned when he couldn't just resurrect you.\"    Professor Duke was sitting behind a text, gently turning the pages of a book. The pages were black, with embroidered golden text, in a language which was half imagery, half symbols that Kyle had never seen.  He spoke quietly, \"Is that Dryadic?\"  Duke sighed, \"No. That language is almost lost. This... This language has long been lost to time.\"  The professor looked up sadly, \"So, you have become a Necromancer, just as you dreamed.\"  Kyle winced, \"Being a ghost sucks. When people walk through you... It's... Gross.\"  Duke managed the smallest of smiles, \"Indeed... But your situation is not great. You may have noticed that your magical ability is somewhat... Tarnished.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"I have no blood, so no Aimimancy for me.\"  \"No any-mancy.\" Duke sighed and shrugged, \"You are stuck, the only magic you can possibly use is Necromancy.\"  Kyle winced, \"So what now? How do I rebind myself to my body?\"  Duke looked at him, and shrugged, \"You may know that to be the solution, which is impressive... But I can't help you until you resurrect yourself, Kyle.\"  The student looked at the professor with concern, \"What do you mean? You are the only Necromancer alive! If you can't help... What the hell does that mean?\"  Duke shook his head, \"Teaching Necromancy... I don't know... Here's an example. Describe the colour blue to me.\"  Kyle blinked, \"Blue? It's a light colour. Between red and green on the colour spectrum.\"  Duke laughed, \"Yes... But tell me what it looks like.\"  Kyle opened his mouth, paused and shrugged, \"No idea. You have to see it.\"  \"Precisely.\" Duke said and smiled, \"To be a Necromancer, you must first already know Necromancy. It's next to impossible to describe.\"  Kyle sighed, \"So I'm stuck here, with only you and Wes.\"  Duke's face darkened, \"Never trust Wes Anderson. There's a reason they burned his body before he could bring himself back.\"  Kyle winced, running a hand through his hair, \"So, I'm stuck between a ghost and a professor, in the land of nobody knows I'm alive.\"  Duke shrugged, \"Pretty much. I will let Fiona and Abigail know you are alive, if you wish.\"  Kyle shook his head, \"I'll tell them myself. Soon.\"  Duke laughed and went back to his book.  Kyle walked through the professor's door, more than a little frustrated and annoyed.    Fiona sat down at the table quietly, looking at the lunch meal in front of her.  She could feel Abigail watching her, but she couldn't do it.  She couldn't talk.  Not after what happened.  She just... Couldn't.  It was too much, hurt like hell.  She wasn't empty, that would have been a blessing. Instead she felt, and it was... Too much.  Abigail spoke anyway, \"You okay, Fi? After your dad turning up like that?\"  She looked up in surprise, \"Dad?\"  The water nymph looked positively depressed, her scales showing through her skin, large bags beneath her eyes. Her shoulders were slumped, and the colour had faded from her hair.  Abigail winced, \"It was his army.\"  The elf looked down, fighting back tears, \"Fuck him. I don't give a shit.\"  Abigail visibly cringed, and then she whispered, \"Fi, you want to get out of here. Candice and her groupies are coming over.\"  Fiona rubbed her eyes, \"Why? Why can't she just leave me alone?\"  \"Hey, elf.\" Came a bright voice, but she pronounced 'elf' like one might pronounce 'dirt' or 'dust' when you become overly tired of cleaning.  Fiona ground her teeth together, grey creeping into her usually blonde hair, \"What do you want, Candice?\"  The girl looked at the plate in front of Fiona, \"You actually got the kitchens to serve a salad. Awesome. I'll take it.\"  \"Get lost, Candice.\" Abigail growled, the girl jerked her head, glaring, \"Shut up, nymph. This has nothing to do with you or your kind.\"  Abigail stood up, her fists clenching, \"Don't push me. Last night sucked.\"  Candice laughed, \"Oh yeah. You two had detention... Say, where's your boyfriend? Still having nightmares?\"  Fiona's ears flashed red, and she glared up at the other girl, \"Kyle was killed.\"  Candice burst out laughing, \"Poor little elf. No Blood Mage to protect her anymore.\"  Fiona felt a tear slip out of the corner of one of her eyes, and she trembled. It took everything in her not to thrash the girl to death.  Then the table started vibrating.  Candice looked at it, \"Seriously elf? You going to throw a table at me?\"  Fiona looked at it with concern, \"That's not Terramancy.\"  Abigail winced, \"I'm not doing that either.\"  Then there was a loud sound as Candice was sent flying, and the table was where she had been.  Fiona stared as she saw a man standing there, angry as hell, and then he was gone.  She looked over at Abigail, \"Did you...?\"  The nymph was wide eyed, \"Was that...?\"  The two looked at each other, smiling, and Abigail laughed, \"Thanks, Kyle.\"  There was no response, but the two felt hope again.  They'd seen him, if for a moment.    Kyle punched the air.  \"I did something!\" He felt like dancing, but seeing his two friends there, with tears in their eyes, sobered him up quickly.  He sighed and looked at the table.  Moving it had taken a lot of effort, but it hadn't moved normally. He'd grabbed it, or tried hard to, and then tried to throw it, but it had only moved a couple feet, and then he had become intangible again.  But when he was moving the table, he'd moved fast enough that the people around him had almost seemed to not move at all.  The result was that the force of the table hitting Candice had launched her halfway across the room and through a stone wall.  One of the professors was taking her to the nurse via stretcher.  Kyle frowned, thinking.  He was in the process of discovering a new magic, one he knew ignored the normal rules of reality.  Yet he knew, it wouldn't actually ignore the rules, they were simply more complex than most people understood them to be.  He knew that in physics, entangled particles were open to manipulation through observation, whether that observation happened before or after the event. Time was a malleable concept.  Altering the flow at which time affected some particles would not be beyond reason.  Highly unusual for a magic, however.  Necromancy was like Vitamancy, in that it allowed the binding of life force and locations, but it could return the vital essence that was life, where once there was none.  The key word, was return.  Kyle smiled slowly, one of the key concepts for Necromancy had to be time, it's nature and how it affected objects individually.    Professor Maidr fluttered her tiny wings in frustration as she looked down at the young girl in her care.  She glanced over at the Dryad standing nearby, \"What happened to her?\"  Duke smiled softly, \"She picked a fight with Fiona Applesilver and Abigail Ignis after the death of Kyle Kilroy.\"  Maidr frowned, \"Fiona flung her through a wall?\"  \"Kyle did.\" Duke replied with a grin, the professor examining the girl, \"He flung a table at her. Not with much force, mind you.\"  Maidr blinked, \"Not much force?\"  \"He displaced her.\" Duke shrugged, his roots creaking, \"He altered the flow of time, displaced her, and allowed the timeline to snap back into place. The latent energy was exerted onto her.\"  Maidr swallowed, shaking her head, \"So, Kyle really is haunting the school?\"  \"He's attempting to bring himself back.\" Duke said and frowned, \"If there was ever another who could fluke the way into becoming a Necromancer... It's Kilroy. He's nothing short of a genius.\"  Maidr sighed, \"Genius or not, he killed her.\"  Duke nodded gravely, \"Indeed he did. He struck her down. I have brought her back... The healing of this fragile body, I leave in your capable hands.\"  Maidr swallowed, \"Aren't there consequences from dying?\"  \"She will need to be informed, yes.\" Duke said and his brow crinkled, a strange thing on something made from bark, \"I am not certain she will be able to survive the consequences.\"  Maidr stared down at the young girl and drew a small wand, made from the feather of a phoenix, and began to chant as she realigned bones, knitted muscles back together, and stretched skin back into shape.    Fiona sat in her chair, yawning tiredly.  It was a struggle.  She didn't know what to think.  Was Kyle really still alive?  Was he stuck as a ghost? Or was he going to resurrect himself?  Did he even want to come back?  She didn't know.  It wasn't like she had been that close to him, but in the short time she had known him, he had astounded her.  First with his cynicism and knowledge...  But the night he died...  Fiona shivered.  She'd never seen so much power in one place.  Duke had been terrifying, killing all of the elves in one moment, but Kyle had been stronger.  A student, an orphan boy less than a quarter of her age, had somehow managed to twist the fabric of reality around her.  He had used magic like a poet might use words.  Fiona blushed.  She knew what she had felt in that moment, and it wasn't admiration, it was something deeper she hadn't quite seen coming.  Sure, he was cute in a ragged sort of way, and he was always incredibly down to earth...  \"Miss Applesilver.\" Professor Bateman spoke harshly, and her head jerked up, \"Sorry, professor.\"  Bateman glared, \"Do you truly need a third bout of detention?\"  Shivers shot down her spine, as the memories washed over her.  Then she saw the spear, drifting forwards, slamming into Kyle.  She heard him scream, the bubble of blood he had formed exploded, turning into a shrapnel bomb that destroyed the landscape around them.  She felt a wrench of magic as the darts stopped in front of her, falling to the ground.  Amidst the dirt and ash she saw Kyle lying on his back, a spear through his chest, icicles creeping out across it.  Tears formed in her eyes, something that elves rarely felt.  She looked at Bateman through misty eyes, his stern face, and she stood quietly, and left the room.  She stood in the hallway, leaning her head against the cool stone, when a hand gently touched her shoulder.  She spun around, blinking.  The corridor was empty.  As she looked back and forth, wondering, Bateman emerged from the classroom, \"I know you've been through a lot... But so you really want to be broken, Fiona?\"  She swallowed, \"Professor, did you see anyone else, out here?\"  Bateman winced, \"He's keeping an eye on you, then?\"  Fiona stared, \"So Kyle really isn't dead then?\"  The professor shook his head, \"Kyle is absolutely dead...

Take the rest of the day off. Mourn Kyle. He may never come back. And if he gets stuck... He can't leave here.\"  Fiona smiled gratefully, \"Thank you, professor.\"  She turned and walked down the hall, feeling like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders.  But the guilt was still there.  She had seen the spear, why hadn't she stopped it?    Abigail sat in the girl's bathroom, her hands immersed into a sink full of water.  It didn't compare to swimming in the least, but it was as close as she could get.  She probably should have been in class, but as excited as Bateman got, he was incredibly boring.  The water around her hands bubbled, and she jerked back in shock, staring at it.  She stared at the reflection on the surface, which sat still, despite the liquid seemingly boiling underneath.  She could see herself clearly, the lines where she had been crying, the scars from Kyle's explosion when he died. She could see her scales and skin, her ragged hair she had neglected to brush.  But she could also see a black haired boy behind her, smiling sadly.  She turned slowly, wincing as she saw the room was empty.  She turned back to the sink, smiling as she saw Kyle.

Too...\" He shouted, and the he was gone.  The bubbles vanished and Abigail burst into heavier tears, leaning on the sink, \"Damn it... I miss you.\"    Fiona sat outside, on a rooftop, staring at the pale white mountains.  Some camp fires still burned, but most of the army had left.  Word had got around about Kyle's death.  ... Death.  Fiona ran her hands over her face. It was ridiculous. She didn't know whether she was supposed to mourn Kyle, or attempt to save him.  He was dead, but he wasn't gone.  She had no clue what to do.  She was older than most at the school, she had been to, and graduated, from three other magical colleges. She had been one of the Black Knights, warrior mages that protected the Elven King.  She had fought vampires, warlocks and natural events.  But this?  Nothing had prepared her for... This.  \"I am so sorry, Kyle.\" She said, tears welling in her eyes, \"I don't know whether to move on, or wait for you... This is tearing me apart.\"  Nothing happened.  It hurt.  She bent her knees to her chest, hung her head, and burst into tears.  He was gone.  He was taking her heart with it.    Bellum Draco stood atop the highest peak of the castle, his tail wrapped around a spire for support, and he looked out from his vantage point.  He could see the individual soldiers walking around the campfires, he could see them sharpening their weapons, donning their armour. Preparing for war.  He sighed heavily, he knew what they wanted.  Kyle Kilroy was not gone.  Only dead.  They would besiege the castle until he handed over Kilroy's body for destruction, or the castle fell.  Either way.  A difficult choice lay at his feet.  The potential for death and destruction was enormous.  Kill Kyle Kilroy, trapping the potentially most powerful and skilled mage in all of human history as a ghost.  Take the College of History and Magic to war with the last of the Elven Kingdoms, fighting the darkest and most numerous army of shadowy souls called up from the depths.  He sighed, he needed to call a Board meeting.    Abigail couldn't sleep.  She tossed and turned, but everything seemed less comfortable.  Eventually she sat up, sweeping her sweat-matted hair behind her, and opened the window, looking out.  She frowned as she saw fireballs dancing in the distance.  The school was under attack again.  Why?  Kyle died.  She heard Kyle's voice echo beside her, \"They know.\"  She spun, staring at the vibrating mass of colour standing in her room, and swallowed, \"Kyle?\"  \"They're coming to stop me. Abigail, you can't let them. If I die, so does the school.\" He seemed to choke up, and then he was gone.  Abigail spun and sprinted into the hallway, and a stone statue immediately stepped down, spinning to face her, a spear in hand, \"What is your business?\"  She blinked as the whole hallway shook, and glared, \"I need to speak to the Headmaster.\"  The statue stood up slowly, but didn't lower the spear, \"For what reason?\"  \"Kyle Kilroy, and the war that's about to happen.\"  The statue turned, \"Follow.\"",

Told me the army was coming for him.\"\n\n\nBellum swished his tale, \"So?\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled, \"He said that I had to stop them. That if we don't, the school is done for.\"\n\n\nBellum scratched his head, \"I don't see it. If I don't hand his body over to be destroyed, then they are going to come in force at this school, and I can't protect them all. The Board is meeting in the morning to vote.\"\n\n\nThe nymph smiled, \"I didn't say you had to stop them. I said I had to.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster looked at his student carefully, \"You got a specialty yet?\"\n\n\n\"Vitamancy.\" She said confidently, and he cocked his head, watching her, \"Is that how you can change from scaled and back again?\"\n\n\nAbigail grinned and nodded, \"Yep.\"\n\n\nBellum shook his head, \"What could one Vitamancer possibly do against that whole army?\"\n\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\n\nBoth spun as the ground shook, and they stared at the figure nearby.\n\n\nKyle stood there, braced, flames engulfing him, burning the ground where he was, and he glared over at them, \"You buy me two days, and I'll be back. No army will ever be able to threaten this school again.\"\n\n\nBellum stared, \"This\u2026 Is not how Duke came back.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"I'm well aware. But unlike Duke, I won't be coming back with a quarter of my power. I'll be coming with all of it.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster felt fear, genuine fear, looking at what was supposed to be a first year student. He could see Kyle standing there, holding open a chasm to the Other Side, as if it was nothing more than a booby-trapped doorway.\n\n\nIf Kyle managed to do what he said\u2026 He was right.\n\n\nNo army would stand a chance against him.\n\n\nEver.\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"The vote goes to the Board. They make the final decision.\"\n\n\nKyle scratched his flaming chin, \"How long do I have?\"\n\n\nBellum sighed, \"Seven hours.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, and vanished, the flames disappearing. Leaving a small charred patch.\n\n\nThe half-dragon turned back to the nymph, \"Seven hours is a long time\u2026 What do you think Kyle is going to do?\"\n\n\nAbigail looked back at the patch of burned stone, \"Make an entrance. What else?\"\n\n\n\"Thankyou.\" He nodded, \"You can go.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona jerked awake, fists clenched, and she collapsed backwards onto the bed when she saw who it was.\n\n\n\"What do you want, Aby?\" She groaned, pulling the blanket over her head, but the nymph pulled it back, \"We have serious issues. I want your help.\"\n\n\nFiona sighed and glared, \"What is it?\"\n\n\n\"An army is massing outside to attack the school and destroy Kyle.\" Abigail said and smiled, \"He wanted me to stop the army. By myself.\"\n\n\nFiona leaned up on her elbows, \"I can't have heard that right.\"\n\n\n\"He said something about a Vitamancer being all that was needed.\" Abigail said with a shrug, \"But, the Board is voting on whether to hand him over, or take the school to war in seven hours.\"\n\n\nFiona winced, \"What did Kyle look like? When he talked?\"\n\n\nAbigail grinned, \"Normal. Except for the surrounded by flames part.\"\n\n\n\"Pyromancy?\" Fiona said dubiously, \"From beyond the grave? That is\u2026 Weird.\"\n\n\n\"Terrified Draco for some reason.\" Abigail shrugged, and the elf swung her legs out of bed, \"So let me guess, you want to go troll Professor Gallagher for info on Vitamancy at war. You want me to somehow predict how he's going to screw over the Board meeting, and fix it.\"\n\n\n\"No fixing needed.\" A voice spoke normally, and both girls spun, and Fiona stared, \"Are you back, Kyle?\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, standing where he was, \"Not quite. I could be\u2026 But I don't want to yet. A thing or two I need to work out. I need forty eight hours. I need both of you to give me that.\"\n\n\nFiona sprang from the bed, catching him in a hug, and he vanished.\n\n\nShe fell forwards onto the stone, but felt a hand catch her, she looked up at him, \"What was that?\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"Sorry\u2026 You\u2026 Surprised me. Takes a fair bit of concentration to remain physically here.\"\n\n\nAbigail coughed, \"Um\u2026 Moving on from you two\u2026 What the hell are you thinking, Kyle? Me versus an army?\"\n\n\n\"Six armies.\" Kyle said quickly, he rubbed his chin, \"Look\u2026 This isn't going to be easy. In fact, it's going to suck balls. King Applesilver is not the only man coming to burn my corpse and make sure I can't come back to life. I could stop them, but not right now. If you give me forty eight hours, then I can stop all of them at once.\"\n\n\nAbigail glared, \"And you want us, two students, to stop six armies? Whilst you fart around as a ghost?\"\n\n\n\"I am not farting around.\" Kyle growled, \"I'm actually living through compressed time. I've spent nearly six hundred years as a dead guy. Missing you guys a lot. Only having Wes Anderson for company is a fate I would wish on no one else. The man died as a werewolf.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, looking at him carefully, \"You're messing with time? Mages shouldn't touch that stuff. It's crazy dangerous.\"\n\n\n\"It's part of my theory on magical particle entanglement, and observational history.\" Kyle said and smiled softly, \"Don't worry, I mess with far more dangerous things. Like the fact that resurrecting oneself unbalances the dead and the living, and so nature kills someone for you.\"\n\n\nFiona held up her hands, pointing at both, \"Shut up. Present moment, armies. Plural.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"Vitamancy is the key to stopping them. Armies are incredibly political machines. If those in charge of the key components of each army disagree with another army, then the target falls into obscurity. In-fighting can be useful, but turning multiple armies against each other allows us to more fully protect ourselves.\"\n\n\nAbigail scratched her head, \"I can't mess with people's heads. That's more\u2026 Sanamancy.\"\n\n\n\"You will mess with their heads.\" Kyle grinned, \"But in a different way. Turn people into each other. Transmorph their skin, make them look like their favourite enemy. But not vice versa. Do transmorph the enemy, but into someone else, who you also transmorph. Turn a series of generals into each other in non-direct ways, so that no one has a clue what is happening.\" He paused for breath and then shrugged, \"It doesn't have to be generals of course, any well placed, smart and efficient soldier could do the trick.\"\n\n\nAbigail glared at him, \"You are an asshole sometimes, Kyle.\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"I know. But this\u2026 This is important. Please.\"\n\n\nFiona looked at her friend and swallowed, \"Can you do it?\"\n\n\nAbigail shot a look of pure death, \"Why would I want to?\"\n\n\n\"You could always transmorph my dad into a toad.\" Fiona smiled sheepishly, \"I'd pay you to do that.\"\n\n\nAbigail sighed heavily, \"I can do it, but from no more than ten feet away. There's rules with this stuff.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"True\u2026 But the rules are different than you think. Sort of what I'm doing, establishing the real rules and perfecting my skill with\u2026 You would call it Necromancy. I'd say it is the root of all magic, and can thus leverage any magic into existence.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"You know something to help me?\"\n\n\nKyle vanished for a moment, and then reappeared in a burst of flame, patting himself down, \"That was a bad one. Oh well.\" He held out his hand, holding a twist of grass, \"Wrap this around the wand you made\u2026 Was it last night for you?\"\n\n\nAbigail swallowed, \"Night before.\"\n\n\nShe took it and wrapped it around her wand, pulling it from a pocket, \"So\u2026 Now what? I've got a branch with a piece of grass on it.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"That piece of grass has never grown. I made it. From\u2026 I guess what would make the most amount of sense to you would be\u2026 Raw Vitamancy.\"\n\n\nAbigail flicked her wrist, and her eyes widened, she looked at Fiona, \"It's legit.\"\n\n\nThe elf looked over at Kyle, smiling ruefully, \"What the hell is happening to you?\"\n\n\n\"I'm creating a unified theory of magic.\" He said and smiled, and then stepped over to her, and bent down, whispering into her ear quietly, \"I think I've even discovered Diligeremancy.\"\n\n\nFiona stared at him, her heart beating fast, \"Please\u2026\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"Hey, I'm almost your age now.\"\n\n\n\"Don't you dare kiss!\" Abigail shouted, and they both looked at her, \"Armies. Plural. War. Kyle, go do what you damn well have to do!\"\n\n\nHe vanished and Fiona collapsed onto the edge of the bed, suddenly feeling weak, \"That was\u2026 He actually likes me?\"\n\n\nAbigail rolled her eyes, \"A pure sociopath decides to make friends. Of course he cares about you.\"\n\n\nThe elf felt her ears redden, \"Do\u2026 Do you think it could work?\"\n\n\n\"Shut up.\" Abigail said with a heavy sigh, \"Forget it. Please.\"\n\n\nFiona looked over, \"What's up with you? All hyper and jumpy? Kyle's alive!\"\n\n\n\"Not yet. We have to buy him some time.\" Abigail growled, and then she sighed, her face softening and she dropped onto the bed, \"I'm sorry\u2026 I was\u2026 Jealous.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, \"Say\u2026 What?\"\n\n\n\"I like him.\" Abigail said sheepishly and shrugged, \"He's kinda hot, broody, but absolutely generous and kind. Not to mention brilliant.\"\n\n\nFiona smiled, \"He chose you for his army-stopping plan.\"\n\n\n\"I think his plan stinks.\" Abigail retorted, \"He's just trying to buy time. I don't trust him that much. We have to stop several armies. That takes more than confusion waiting for some all-powerful mage to turn up.\"\n\n\nFiona smiled and stood up, \"No\u2026 It takes politics.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"Can you help us?\"\n\n\n\"I am Princess Applesilver, a member of my father's personal guard.\" She grinned, \"I'll get the Board of the School onside.\"\n\n\nAbigail nodded, \"I'll get the professors together. See what we can do.\"\n\n\n\"Don't forget Duke. He is the only one who has a clue what is up with Kyle.\" Fiona said and then blinked, \"You know what? I think it was Duke who talked to us the other day.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled, \"Truce? No dibs on Kyle till after?\"\n\n\nFiona shook her hand and then grinned, \"I know there's the girlfriend code and all\u2026 But Kyle is totally mine. He told me there was a magic of love.\"\n\n\nAbigail slapped her own face, \"That is so\u2026 Corny.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail swallowed, looking at the room of professors, it wasn't all of them, only half a dozen. But these were men, women and others that had spent her lifetime as masters of their skills.\n\n\nShe smiled, trying to look confident, \"There is a war coming. We have to fight it.\"\n\n\nProfessor Burke, golem, laughed a harsh laugh, \"Truly? For what reason must we fight?\"\n\n\nAbigail pulled out her wand, \"I made the core of this wand with Professor Duke. It's the wand of a Vitamancer. However, the piece of grass that is all part of the wand? It's\u2026 Big.\"\n\n\nProfessor Gallagher sat up from his seat, the man's eyes lighting up, \"Good god\u2026 Is that what I think it is?\"\n\n\nAbigail spun the wand idly, \"Kyle gave it to me. He wants us to buy him forty-eight hours.\"\n\n\nGallagher stood up, walking over, \"Can I hold it?\"\n\n\n\"No.\" The nymph said angrily, and the professor turned to the others, \"That thing that looks like grass, is\u2026 It's made of raw magic. Attuned to the frequency that is the Vitamantic essence.\"\n\n\nThe professor's looked at her, and the wand in her hand dubiously, and Abigail smiled, \"Kyle is working on a unified theory of magic. Says he could stop all six armies on their way as soon as he comes back, but he needs forty eight hours.\"\n\n\nBurke leaned back in his seat, \"How could he learn so much, in so short a time?\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"Something to do with compressing time.\"\n\n\nThe dryad in the back corner jerked, \"Kilroy is modifying his own personal time stream?\"\n\n\nAbigail scratched her head, \"I'm not sure it's that simple. He said a lot of high end stuff in a very short amount of time.\"\u000b\nDuke shook his head, \"Then we must buy him the time. He could solve the issue of equatorial stabilisation. The world was destroyed by ice. He could help us rebuild it. Drive the monsters back in the space of months or even weeks.\"\n\n\nThe other professors looked at him in surprise and Duke sighed, \"We all know, since the ice age caused a near global extinction, the world has been in hell\u2026 Kyle may be able to find us a way back from that.\"\n\n\nProfessor Burke sighed heavily, \"Necromancy is not the answer to everything, Professor Duke.\"\n\n\n\"Yes it is.\" Kyle said, appearing only for a moment, and then he was gone.\n\n\nAll the professors looked around, and Professor Duke laughed, \"And why would that be, Kyle?\"\n\n\nHe appeared again, looking frustrated, \"There's no such thing as Necromancy. Now shut up, I don't have much time.\"\n\n\nThen he was gone.\n\n\nAbigail grinned and rubbed her hands together, \"Now, how are we going to defend the school? Kyle had some idea about Vitamancy and confusion amongst armies. I think we can't risk that.\"\n\n\nProfessor Burke stood slowly, \"The walls of this school will never be breached.\"\n\n\n\"Overconfident!\" Kyle yelled appearing, and he sighed heavily, \"Obviously I have to step in. You are acting like idiots. This school was designed to withstand attack yes, but not by everything the world can throw at it. You have the Elven King on your doorstep, the Vampiric Armies of the Shaddowlands are about a six hours away, the Troll Hoarde is hiding out in the hills, choosing when to attack. The human kingdoms of Malatic, Balsa, and New Rome are less than\u2026 Eighteen hours away.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"You think this place impregnable. I could bring it down with two spells. Two.\"\n\n\nBurke glared, \"You are nothing more than student. Be silent.\"\n\n\nKyle pulled a small black stick from his waist, \"This is a wand that channels Necromancy, or in other words, all magic. None has ever been made before. Call me a student again.\"\n\n\nBurke sneered, \"Student.\"\n\n\nKyle flicked his wrist, and the professor turned to sand, vanishing. Kyle tapped his foot, looking bored and then flicked his wrist again, and the sand reformed into the golem.\n\n\nKyle sneered, \"Enjoy your time on the Other Side? Ask about me, per chance?\"\n\n\nProfessor Burke collapsed backwards into his seat, \"You are a monster.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"I dare do all that becomes a man. He who dares less\u2026 Is none.\"\n\n\nProfessor Duke spoke up, \"Quiet. Kyle, you have study. We have a school to defend\u2026 The Board will be a problem.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled, \"Fiona is trying to take care of that. Now\u2026 Are we ready?\"\n\n\nKyle vanished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBellum Draco sat at the head of a table, with seven others sitting around the table. They were parents of past and present students, but more importantly they were the heads of the most powerful families remaining in the world.\n\n\nDraco smiled softly, \"We have a decision to make.\"\n\n\nOne elf male turned to him, \"The decision has been made. We will hand Kyle Kilroy's body over. And you will step down from your position as Headmaster.\"\n\n\nDraco blinked, looking around the table, \"Meeting without the Headmaster? Isn't that against the Code the school was built on?\"\n\n\nThe elf shrugged, \"The circumstances required it.\"\n\n\nDraco leaned back in his seat, \"The Board has breached the Code.\"\n\n\nThe room shook as a dozen statues dropped from their positions around the room, weapons levelling at the throat of all present, including Draco.\n\n\nAnother statue stood by himself, \"The Code must be upheld. For what reason was it breached? This is your only appeal.\"\n\n\nThe elf glared at Draco, \"Are you mad?\"\n\n\nThe statue standing alone sighed, \"Remove his head. He will not follow the Code.\"\n\n\nThe elf screamed, for a moment, as a sword carried out the order.\n\n\n\"The Code must be upheld. For what reason was it breached? This is your only appeal.\" The statue leaned forward, \"Follow the Code.\"\n\n\nDraco sighed, \"Armies are about to besiege, or are besieging, the school. They will surrender if we hand the body of a student, in transition to becoming a Necromancer, over to them for destruction.\"\n\n\nThe statue nodded, \"How did the Board breach the Code?\"\n\n\nDraco shrugged, ignoring the blade at his throat, \"They met without the Headmaster.\"\n\n\nThe statue sighed heavily, \"Destruction of the entire Board would be the normal operational recommendation.\"\n\n\nThey stiffened in their seats, but the statue continued, \"As war is imminent, the Board will not be slain. However, marshal law will be declared. The Headmaster, as he has not shown bias, or failure in his duties, will be given control of the school. We will all report directly to you, Headmaster Bellum Draco.\"\n\n\nHe nodded as the swords were withdrawn and sheathed, \"Man the barricades. This school is at war, as of this moment.\"\n\n\nHe felt the entire school shake as every statue moved to their positions, manning weapons.\n\n\nBellum smiled tightly, he knew the golem-like statue army wouldn't be nearly enough. They may number in the thousands, and be immune to the majority of magic, but they could easily be outsmarted and destroyed.\n\n\nHe stood, looking at the Board, \"Barricade yourselves in your rooms. This is a war. Understood?\"",

From\u2026 I guess what would make the most amount of sense to you would be\u2026 Raw Vitamancy.\"  Abigail flicked her wrist, and her eyes widened, she looked at Fiona, \"It's legit.\"  The elf looked over at Kyle, smiling ruefully, \"What the hell is happening to you?\"  \"I'm creating a unified theory of magic.\" He said and smiled, and then stepped over to her, and bent down, whispering into her ear quietly, \"I think I've even discovered Diligeremancy.\"  Fiona stared at him, her heart beating fast, \"Please\u2026\"  He shrugged, \"Hey, I'm almost your age now.\"  \"Don't you dare kiss!\" Abigail shouted, and they both looked at her, \"Armies. Plural. War. Kyle, go do what you damn well have to do!\"  He vanished and Fiona collapsed onto the edge of the bed, suddenly feeling weak, \"That was\u2026 He actually likes me?\"  Abigail rolled her eyes, \"A pure sociopath decides to make friends. Of course he cares about you.\"  The elf felt her ears redden, \"Do\u2026 Do you think it could work?\"  \"Shut up.\" Abigail said with a heavy sigh, \"Forget it. Please.\"  Fiona looked over, \"What's up with you? All hyper and jumpy? Kyle's alive!\"  \"Not yet. We have to buy him some time.\" Abigail growled, and then she sighed, her face softening and she dropped onto the bed, \"I'm sorry\u2026 I was\u2026 Jealous.\"  Fiona blinked, \"Say\u2026 What?\"  \"I like him.\" Abigail said sheepishly and shrugged, \"He's kinda hot, broody, but absolutely generous and kind. Not to mention brilliant.\"  Fiona smiled, \"He chose you for his army-stopping plan.\"  \"I think his plan stinks.\" Abigail retorted, \"He's just trying to buy time. I don't trust him that much. We have to stop several armies. That takes more than confusion waiting for some all-powerful mage to turn up.\"  Fiona smiled and stood up, \"No\u2026 It takes politics.\"  Abigail frowned, \"Can you help us?\"  \"I am Princess Applesilver, a member of my father's personal guard.\" She grinned, \"I'll get the Board of the School onside.\"  Abigail nodded, \"I'll get the professors together. See what we can do.\"  \"Don't forget Duke. He is the only one who has a clue what is up with Kyle.\" Fiona said and then blinked, \"You know what? I think it was Duke who talked to us the other day.\"  Abigail smiled, \"Truce? No dibs on Kyle till after?\"  Fiona shook her hand and then grinned, \"I know there's the girlfriend code and all\u2026 But Kyle is totally mine. He told me there was a magic of love.\"  Abigail slapped her own face, \"That is so\u2026 Corny.\"    Abigail swallowed, looking at the room of professors, it wasn't all of them, only half a dozen. But these were men, women and others that had spent her lifetime as masters of their skills.  She smiled, trying to look confident, \"There is a war coming. We have to fight it.\"  Professor Burke, golem, laughed a harsh laugh, \"Truly? For what reason must we fight?\"  Abigail pulled out her wand, \"I made the core of this wand with Professor Duke. It's the wand of a Vitamancer. However, the piece of grass that is all part of the wand? It's\u2026 Big.\"  Professor Gallagher sat up from his seat, the man's eyes lighting up, \"Good god\u2026 Is that what I think it is?\"  Abigail spun the wand idly, \"Kyle gave it to me. He wants us to buy him forty-eight hours.\"  Gallagher stood up, walking over, \"Can I hold it?\"  \"No.\" The nymph said angrily, and the professor turned to the others, \"That thing that looks like grass, is\u2026 It's made of raw magic. Attuned to the frequency that is the Vitamantic essence.\"  The professor's looked at her, and the wand in her hand dubiously, and Abigail smiled, \"Kyle is working on a unified theory of magic. Says he could stop all six armies on their way as soon as he comes back, but he needs forty eight hours.\"  Burke leaned back in his seat, \"How could he learn so much, in so short a time?\"  Abigail shrugged, \"Something to do with compressing time.\"  The dryad in the back corner jerked, \"Kilroy is modifying his own personal time stream?\"  Abigail scratched her head, \"I'm not sure it's that simple. He said a lot of high end stuff in a very short amount of time.\"\u000b\nDuke shook his head, \"Then we must buy him the time. He could solve the issue of equatorial stabilisation. The world was destroyed by ice. He could help us rebuild it. Drive the monsters back in the space of months or even weeks.\"  The other professors looked at him in surprise and Duke sighed, \"We all know, since the ice age caused a near global extinction, the world has been in hell\u2026 Kyle may be able to find us a way back from that.\"  Professor Burke sighed heavily, \"Necromancy is not the answer to everything, Professor Duke.\"  \"Yes it is.\" Kyle said, appearing only for a moment, and then he was gone.  All the professors looked around, and Professor Duke laughed, \"And why would that be, Kyle?\"  He appeared again, looking frustrated, \"There's no such thing as Necromancy. Now shut up, I don't have much time.\"  Then he was gone.  Abigail grinned and rubbed her hands together, \"Now, how are we going to defend the school? Kyle had some idea about Vitamancy and confusion amongst armies. I think we can't risk that.\"  Professor Burke stood slowly, \"The walls of this school will never be breached.\"  \"Overconfident!\" Kyle yelled appearing, and he sighed heavily, \"Obviously I have to step in. You are acting like idiots. This school was designed to withstand attack yes, but not by everything the world can throw at it. You have the Elven King on your doorstep, the Vampiric Armies of the Shaddowlands are about a six hours away, the Troll Hoarde is hiding out in the hills, choosing when to attack. The human kingdoms of Malatic, Balsa, and New Rome are less than\u2026 Eighteen hours away.\"  Kyle smiled, \"You think this place impregnable. I could bring it down with two spells. Two.\"  Burke glared, \"You are nothing more than student. Be silent.\"  Kyle pulled a small black stick from his waist, \"This is a wand that channels Necromancy, or in other words, all magic. None has ever been made before. Call me a student again.\"  Burke sneered, \"Student.\"  Kyle flicked his wrist, and the professor turned to sand, vanishing. Kyle tapped his foot, looking bored and then flicked his wrist again, and the sand reformed into the golem.  Kyle sneered, \"Enjoy your time on the Other Side? Ask about me, per chance?\"  Professor Burke collapsed backwards into his seat, \"You are a monster.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"I dare do all that becomes a man. He who dares less\u2026 Is none.\"  Professor Duke spoke up, \"Quiet. Kyle, you have study. We have a school to defend\u2026 The Board will be a problem.\"  Abigail smiled, \"Fiona is trying to take care of that. Now\u2026 Are we ready?\"  Kyle vanished.    Bellum Draco sat at the head of a table, with seven others sitting around the table. They were parents of past and present students, but more importantly they were the heads of the most powerful families remaining in the world.  Draco smiled softly, \"We have a decision to make.\"  One elf male turned to him, \"The decision has been made. We will hand Kyle Kilroy's body over. And you will step down from your position as Headmaster.\"  Draco blinked, looking around the table, \"Meeting without the Headmaster? Isn't that against the Code the school was built on?\"  The elf shrugged, \"The circumstances required it.\"  Draco leaned back in his seat, \"The Board has breached the Code.\"  The room shook as a dozen statues dropped from their positions around the room, weapons levelling at the throat of all present, including Draco.  Another statue stood by himself, \"The Code must be upheld. For what reason was it breached? This is your only appeal.\"  The elf glared at Draco, \"Are you mad?\"  The statue standing alone sighed, \"Remove his head. He will not follow the Code.\"  The elf screamed, for a moment, as a sword carried out the order.  \"The Code must be upheld. For what reason was it breached? This is your only appeal.\" The statue leaned forward, \"Follow the Code.\"  Draco sighed, \"Armies are about to besiege, or are besieging, the school. They will surrender if we hand the body of a student, in transition to becoming a Necromancer, over to them for destruction.\"  The statue nodded, \"How did the Board breach the Code?\"  Draco shrugged, ignoring the blade at his throat, \"They met without the Headmaster.\"  The statue sighed heavily, \"Destruction of the entire Board would be the normal operational recommendation.\"  They stiffened in their seats, but the statue continued, \"As war is imminent, the Board will not be slain. However, marshal law will be declared. The Headmaster, as he has not shown bias, or failure in his duties, will be given control of the school. We will all report directly to you, Headmaster Bellum Draco.\"  He nodded as the swords were withdrawn and sheathed, \"Man the barricades. This school is at war, as of this moment.\"  He felt the entire school shake as every statue moved to their positions, manning weapons.  Bellum smiled tightly, he knew the golem-like statue army wouldn't be nearly enough. They may number in the thousands, and be immune to the majority of magic, but they could easily be outsmarted and destroyed.  He stood, looking at the Board, \"Barricade yourselves in your rooms. This is a war. Understood?\"",

I declared war.\"\n\n\nFiona glared, \"I noticed. I was going to get them on side.\"\n\n\n\"They breached the Code.\" Draco said and turned, \"Now\u2026 Convince me why I shouldn't allow Kyle's body to be destroyed?\"\n\n\nFiona clenched her fists, \"As Princess Applesilver, and a member of the Black Knights, I request a meeting with the Headmaster of the College of History and Magic.\"\n\n\nDraco stared at her, \"Ah. Granted.\"\n\n\n\"You're an idiot!\" She screamed, her hair immediately turning jet-black, and her eyes flickered between their typical blue, and a strange red.\n\n\nDraco shrugged, \"War was coming. They were going to dismiss me, and hand Kyle over.\"\n\n\nFiona clenched her fists, her eyes fading fully to red, the room beginning to shake from her rage, \"Do you have the slightest idea what you have set in motion?\"\n\n\nThe half-dragon glared at her, \"Have you forgotten who I am? I am Draco Bellum.\"\n\n\nA wind whipped out of nowhere, surrounding the room, \"You are not a danger to me, Princess Applesilver.\"\n\n\n\"But I am.\" Came a growl, and Fiona immediately snapped back to blonde-haired and blue-eyed, staring, \"Kyle.\"\n\n\nHe waved a hand, \"Not now.\"\n\n\nKyle glared over at Draco and twisted his hand, and the man collapsed to his knees, as the ghost strode over to him, resting a hand on the Headmaster's forehead. \"You were the most powerful Ventusamancer in the world, Headmaster. Not anymore. I am. And I'm still dead.\"\n\n\nDraco strained, lifting his head with incredible effort, \"What do you want Kyle?\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"Less interruptions. I'm not exactly dealing with simple magic over here, on the Other Side.\" He frowned and glared, \"But if you won't protect the school, then I will be forced to crack open the gate to the Other Side, and summon an army that will protect me whilst I'm busy.\"\n\n\nKyle vanished.\n\n\nFiona swallowed, looking at the Headmaster dizzily getting to his feet, \"What was that threat?\"\n\n\nDraco winced, \"He's\u2026 Dangerous. Do you understand that? Kyle just threatened to do far worse than the ice did when it nearly killed this world.\"\n\n\nFiona clenched her fists, \"So stop being stupid. You don't have a choice about protecting Kyle. He could kill us all, but he's trying not to.\"\n\n\nDraco shook his head, \"Once this is over... I'm going to kill Kyle, myself. Understood?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail stood on a stone wall, looking out across the cliff, at the armies waiting below.\n\n\nShe swallowed nervously, feeling the fear.\n\n\nShe drew her wand slowly, feeling the professors either side of her do the same.\n\n\nShe tightened her jaw, reaching down into herself, hardening herself.\n\n\nShe was terrified.\n\n\nThis was everything she feared, everything she was paralyzed by.\n\n\nBut...\n\n\nAbigail smiled, she would do this.\n\n\nAlways.\n\n\nFor one guy.\n\n\nShe blushed, now she was sounding like a crushing stereotypical wanna-be girlfriend.\n\n\nIt was... Slightly humiliating.\n\n\nShe was a nymph!\n\n\nGuys were meant to fall every time she walked around a corner.\n\n\nAnd now she was doing something utterly crazy for a guy who wasn't even alive anymore.\n\n\nAbigail smiled, looking at the army, tears in her eyes, \"Screw it.\"\n\n\nShe raised her wand, feeling magic flowing through her, a torrent she had never felt, like she wasn't a channel anymore, she was all that stood in the way of all the magic in the world.\n\n\nAbigail winced, trying to slow it, stop it from burning her away completely.\n\n\nAnd then she spoke, feeling the professors speaking alongside her.\n\n\n\"Lorem in circulo, redigendi in unum et potestate!\"\n\n\nAbigail felt a load lift off. It wasn't that the power coursing through her was less, she could now carry more.\n\n\nThey'd linked.\n\n\nA circle of eight mages, their power was exacerbated, amplified by each other.\n\n\nAbigail smiled, looking at the army marching towards the school walls, and she laughed, taking control of the power of the circle, \"Let's make them pay.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing Alfr Applesilver sat in a heavily guarded tent, staring down at a map, with a dozen small magical representations of soldiers scurrying over it.\n\n\nHe winced, looking at the map of the castle walls, and how every time a magical figure neared it, it vanished in a puff of smoke.\n\n\nHe rubbed his forehead, sighing heavily, \"Draw back.\"\n\n\nA nearby general stared at him in surprise, \"Sorry, milord?\"\n\n\nAlfr glared up at him the man stiffening, seemingly choking, and he roared, \"Draw back my army!\"\n\n\nHe released the man and turned clenching his fists, he glanced sideways at a young elf, bound in iron chains, and he glared, \"Summon another.\"\n\n\nThe elf cringed in terror, and whispered quickly.\n\n\nA pillar of stone rose up out of the ground, and Alfr shouted in anger, punching and shattering the pillar to smithereens. He turned back to the map, \"Clean up the mess.\"\n\n\nAs the stone melted back into the earth, he glared at the map, \"The castle walls are being protected by someone with extraordinary magic. Probably a circle or two led by someone with skill.\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"Fine. Only one thing can match a circle of mages. Eight interlinked circles. Bring up the Black Knights. Tell them to tear the wall down, ignore any assault.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis brilliant red eyes darted around, staring at the green grass, the trees with their yellowing leaves. He struggled to fight back his revulsion.\n\n\nThe Shadowlands were dead, nothing but ash and dust. Only a handful of trees remained standing, and they were nothing but burned out hollow husks.\n\n\nHe would have felt fear, if that was an emotion in his repertoire, but his kind could not feel fear.\n\n\nHe smiled softly as he crested the hill, spotting the famous castle standing on a cliff, with a hill leading down to a lake that surrounded it.\n\n\nThis was a place he knew well, one he had snuck into countless times, but for less serious situations.\n\n\nAndre raised a hand, feeling the enormous army behind him slow to a stop, and he turned to face it, baring his fangs, \"We are vampires! There is a man within, who wishes to become a Necromancer!\"\n\n\nRoars of anger greeted him, and he smiled, \"Let's tear it down. Brick by brick.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scream of rage boiled out of the nymph's throat, as Abigail flicked her wand, twisting aside a spell, glaring down at the Elvish circle.\n\n\nShe knew what they were doing.\n\n\nEight circles, combined with an overlapping link.\n\n\nForty eight mages, linked to absolute perfect power.\n\n\nShe was only holding out against their persistent spells for a few very weak reasons. \n\n\nFirstly they were predictable to a tee. Designed to break walls, and burn people. It was easy. \n\n\nSecondly, she possessed raw power that allowed her an edge. It didn't make her stronger than the Circles facing her, but it gave her a resilience that they didn't seem to be able to comprehend. Abigail wasn't surprised at that though - she was shocked by how much her enhanced wand actually gave her.\n\n\nHundreds of rocks battered towards the walls, and she flicked her wrist, turning them to sand and halting their velocity, and then she pushed, twisting, and Vitamancy ran through her, following her will, binding to reality. Each grain of sand took on life, and felt her rage flow through it.\n\n\nThey sort out their original creators.\n\n\nShe smiled grimly, they would not stop her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stone hand picked his nose idly, flicking it onto the ground. He looked at the bear roasting on the spit, lifting it for a quick bite. He put it back down and looked at his brothers in arms, his family, and he smiled, showing his many missing teeth, \"Big army over hills.\"\n\n\nVaried comments with grammatical structure far below his own echoed out, and he clumsily scratched the back of his neck, \"Big army wants Necro-mage-y boy.\"\n\n\nThe Troll King, Isaac Isaac, smiled again, \"But army in front\u2026\" He paused, his mouth falling, \"Elvish.\"\n\n\nImmediate howls of anger burst out.\n\n\nHe could feel the hatred burning through every part of his stone body, at the very thought of the pointy-eared beasts.\n\n\nThere was a reason the elves were almost extinct - his army.\n\n\nThe Troll Hoarde had been created for the very purpose.\n\n\nElves had been everywhere when the world began to grow again, after the ice had destroyed nearly everything. They had crushed and beaten at every turn.\n\n\nBut then they found the trolls.\n\n\nThey saw that the teeth of trolls were made from diamond, and that they gathered gold in insane amounts, able to smell it out when they dug into the earth, and so Elven kind had enslave the trolls.\n\n\nHe, not smart by any standard, but smarter than most trolls, had turned the tables and spent every day since the last time he was in chains seeking the end to all elves.\n\n\nIsaac shrugged, \"I say the Hoarde not care about little dead boy\u2026 All Elves in one place.\"\n\n\nHe grinned, \"Let's kill Elves.\"\n\n\nThe roar that answered him shook the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona's ears were bent back beside her head, her hair jet black and her eyes as red as any vampires. She hissed between words, dodging the spears, swords and fists clamouring for her head.\n\n\nShe chanted steadily, the ground beneath her playing parlay with her will, rocks and pebbles tearing free of their home and ripping through her enemies as she spoke.\n\n\nShe disregarded the number of enemies, if she allowed herself to think about it, depression would overwhelm her. She stood, barely a hundred meters out the front of the School's towering gates, surrounded by an army of stone, and accompanied by a half-dragon warlock, who surpassed all her expectations.\n\n\nShe had known that Bellum Draco was powerful, almost beyond compare.\n\n\nBut the truth was more than that.\n\n\nWhen he called up a hurricane, it engulfed the entire island upon which the School sat, but the deftness of the magic was apparent, with the wind only affecting those that fought against the School. When fire raced from his hands, it was like a spirit of nature itself, racing through enemies, engulfing and incinerating them like a bushfire.\n\n\nHe was terrifying to behold.\n\n\nAs for herself, she threw pebbles by the dozens, turning them into deadly projectiles by throwing them in a spray at a speed that no one could match.\n\n\nBeside her shields and swords clashed, the ground shaking with the heavy foot falls of the stone soldiers as they fought their part.\n\n\nBlood bled across the ground, the blue of the elves mingling with the black of vampires. Traces of dust and stone mingled with the mess, spreading out in front of her, turning a once beautiful landscape into nothing more than a warzone.\n\n\nFiona could feel herself losing her grip on the world, could feel survival instincts kicking in, turning her into a monster that would kill. Destroy everything in sight.\n\n\nShe couldn't think straight, she didn't have the time to.\n\n\nDespite the number of fallen, and the army fighting beside her, she was outnumbered twenty to one at the very least. It was driving her mad.\n\n\nIt didn't matter how many she killed, there was no respite. Spell after spell, weapon after weapon reached out to drag her down to her grave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general in charge of the Malatic Army was a well kept man. His hair was cropped short to his head, his armour perfectly arranged. His eyes were sharp, and his intellect keen.\n\n\nGeneral Damien Haralson was sitting in a chair, inside a tent, the wind blowing loudly outside, smoking a pipe. In his hands was a map, rapidly flashing.\n\n\nThough he had no magic of his own, this map had been devised by him, and he was glad that he had.\n\n\nIt revealed the locations and current actions of every magic user around the School of History and Magic, updated constantly, allowing him to watch the battle as it was currently unfolding.\n\n\nTo be honest with himself, Haralson was slightly confused.\n\n\nThe vampiric forces launching themselves at the castle alone should have been bringing down the walls, let alone the aid that the Elven Kingdom was lending to them.\n\n\nVery few magical forces could be seen at all.\n\n\nA dozen mages on the walls, and two by the gates.\n\n\nHe could see evidence of non-magic wielders as well, by the number falling near the gates, and how those that vanished had little to do with the magic users located there.\n\n\nSome sort of ground force.\n\n\nYet, as to the other defences, it seemed the few on the walls were responsible for the havoc playing out.\n\n\nIt was astonishing.\n\n\nHaralson glanced up, laying the map neatly in his lap as a soldier burst in, dressed in a dancing yellow and green pattern. The spy gulped in air, and Haralson nodded, \"What is it?\"\n\n\n\"The Troll Hoarde is\u2026\" He gulped in air, \"Half a mile up the hill.\"\n\n\nHaralson looked down at the map, placing them in his mind, \"What threat do you think they pose? Any real guards?\"\n\n\nThe spy winced, \"They're packing up to move. From what I managed to hear, they aren't going for the school.\"\n\n\nHaralson laughed in surprise, \"Taking the elves\u2026 That's a smart move if they really want all elves extinct\u2026 Who is their leader?\"\n\n\n\"Isaac Isaac.\"\n\n\nHaralson stared at the spy, \"He's here, himself? Hells bells\u2026 Let's try and stay out of their way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nymph swore violently as a bolt of lightning struck.\n\n\nShe was thrown into the air, a cascade of rocks slamming into her at full force, and she pushed the control of the circle to one of the professors, gripping her wand tight, as she felt herself begin to fall.\n\n\nAs Abigail plummeted downwards, her vision a swirl of sky, filled with screaming vampires, and ground covered in elvish warriors, she realised that the part of the wall where she had been standing was gone.\n\n\nShe was falling towards the ground.\n\n\nThe bastards had actually managed to get the drop on her.\n\n\nHer grip tightened on the wand in her hand, and she twirled it, twisting reality, feeling it bending, breathing, and she let loose her will.\n\n\nThe wind around her took on life, and she felt herself slow as the two spirits of wind held her, lowering her gently to the ground.\n\n\nShe rubbed the dirt on her face, glaring out from beside the wall, at the elves staring at her.\n\n\nThere had to be hundreds of them, staring at her.\n\n\nShe swallowed, it was one on to thousands.\n\n\nAbigail let loose a blood-curdling scream, her scales flaring outwards, and she flicked her wand forward, launching a hex outwards in a wave, traumatising bone, tearing limbs, blistering faces.\n\n\nThe elves rushed towards her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Andrews strode forward, his eyes darting left and right as tents and fires sprang up around him. Cooks dashed to and fro, as soldiers checked their weapons and armour. Smiths were lighting their forges, and sharpening steel on their grindstones.\n\n\nHe smiled as he passed, thanking a cook here, encouraging a soldier here.\n\n\nEmmanuel understood the importance of morale, and he knew that it would be the make-or-break on this battlefield. Though his field of vision was limited by the night beginning to close in, he could see the siege on the school ahead, illuminated by the many fires, and he was not envious of those already engaged.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister of Balsa had sent him with this army to establish a foothold, and ensure the destruction of Kyle Kilroy's body before he awoke as a Necromancer.\n\n\nFrom what he could see, and what his spies had reported, this was an arm's race.\n\n\nMost here wanted the same, but old scores would be settled.\n\n\nTrolls, vampires, elves and humans.\n\n\nThis was going to be a bloodbath, whether he wanted it to be or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Antonio Guerra slammed the metal spike into the ground, erecting the blood red banner, embossed with a golden phoenix, into the ground.\n\n\nHe looked out at the battlefield, smiling grimly.\n\n\nBehind him the efficiency of the New Roman army had already finished establishing the camp, guards and spies already in place.\n\n\nHe knew the delicacy of the situation however, and the precarious situation he found himself in, leading these men to war.\n\n\nThe chance for in-fighting and ticking off the wrong people\u2026 He sighed and looked over at a young nearby boy, a messenger.\n\n\n\"Write this: As General Guerra of the New Roman Empire, I humbly beg audience with King Applesilver, of the last Elven Kingdom, to discuss a combination of efforts and evaluation of an alliance in the destruction of the potential Necromancer.\" He nodded, \"Get one of the eagles to send it.\"\n\n\nHe turned back, looking out at the night with distrust.\n\n\nThis was a war, and with this many sides in one place\u2026 It was certain to go downhill quickly.",

Abigail smiled, looking at the army, tears in her eyes, \"Screw it.\"  She raised her wand, feeling magic flowing through her, a torrent she had never felt, like she wasn't a channel anymore, she was all that stood in the way of all the magic in the world.  Abigail winced, trying to slow it, stop it from burning her away completely.  And then she spoke, feeling the professors speaking alongside her.  \"Lorem in circulo, redigendi in unum et potestate!\"  Abigail felt a load lift off. It wasn't that the power coursing through her was less, she could now carry more.  They'd linked.  A circle of eight mages, their power was exacerbated, amplified by each other.  Abigail smiled, looking at the army marching towards the school walls, and she laughed, taking control of the power of the circle, \"Let's make them pay.\"    King Alfr Applesilver sat in a heavily guarded tent, staring down at a map, with a dozen small magical representations of soldiers scurrying over it.  He winced, looking at the map of the castle walls, and how every time a magical figure neared it, it vanished in a puff of smoke.  He rubbed his forehead, sighing heavily, \"Draw back.\"  A nearby general stared at him in surprise, \"Sorry, milord?\"  Alfr glared up at him the man stiffening, seemingly choking, and he roared, \"Draw back my army!\"  He released the man and turned clenching his fists, he glanced sideways at a young elf, bound in iron chains, and he glared, \"Summon another.\"  The elf cringed in terror, and whispered quickly.  A pillar of stone rose up out of the ground, and Alfr shouted in anger, punching and shattering the pillar to smithereens. He turned back to the map, \"Clean up the mess.\"  As the stone melted back into the earth, he glared at the map, \"The castle walls are being protected by someone with extraordinary magic. Probably a circle or two led by someone with skill.\"  He shrugged, \"Fine. Only one thing can match a circle of mages. Eight interlinked circles. Bring up the Black Knights. Tell them to tear the wall down, ignore any assault.\"    His brilliant red eyes darted around, staring at the green grass, the trees with their yellowing leaves. He struggled to fight back his revulsion.  The Shadowlands were dead, nothing but ash and dust. Only a handful of trees remained standing, and they were nothing but burned out hollow husks.  He would have felt fear, if that was an emotion in his repertoire, but his kind could not feel fear.  He smiled softly as he crested the hill, spotting the famous castle standing on a cliff, with a hill leading down to a lake that surrounded it.  This was a place he knew well, one he had snuck into countless times, but for less serious situations.  Andre raised a hand, feeling the enormous army behind him slow to a stop, and he turned to face it, baring his fangs, \"We are vampires! There is a man within, who wishes to become a Necromancer!\"  Roars of anger greeted him, and he smiled, \"Let's tear it down. Brick by brick.\"    A scream of rage boiled out of the nymph's throat, as Abigail flicked her wand, twisting aside a spell, glaring down at the Elvish circle.  She knew what they were doing.  Eight circles, combined with an overlapping link.  Forty eight mages, linked to absolute perfect power.  She was only holding out against their persistent spells for a few very weak reasons.   Firstly they were predictable to a tee. Designed to break walls, and burn people. It was easy.   Secondly, she possessed raw power that allowed her an edge. It didn't make her stronger than the Circles facing her, but it gave her a resilience that they didn't seem to be able to comprehend. Abigail wasn't surprised at that though - she was shocked by how much her enhanced wand actually gave her.  Hundreds of rocks battered towards the walls, and she flicked her wrist, turning them to sand and halting their velocity, and then she pushed, twisting, and Vitamancy ran through her, following her will, binding to reality. Each grain of sand took on life, and felt her rage flow through it.  They sort out their original creators.  She smiled grimly, they would not stop her.    A stone hand picked his nose idly, flicking it onto the ground. He looked at the bear roasting on the spit, lifting it for a quick bite. He put it back down and looked at his brothers in arms, his family, and he smiled, showing his many missing teeth, \"Big army over hills.\"  Varied comments with grammatical structure far below his own echoed out, and he clumsily scratched the back of his neck, \"Big army wants Necro-mage-y boy.\"  The Troll King, Isaac Isaac, smiled again, \"But army in front\u2026\" He paused, his mouth falling, \"Elvish.\"  Immediate howls of anger burst out.  He could feel the hatred burning through every part of his stone body, at the very thought of the pointy-eared beasts.  There was a reason the elves were almost extinct - his army.  The Troll Hoarde had been created for the very purpose.  Elves had been everywhere when the world began to grow again, after the ice had destroyed nearly everything. They had crushed and beaten at every turn.  But then they found the trolls.  They saw that the teeth of trolls were made from diamond, and that they gathered gold in insane amounts, able to smell it out when they dug into the earth, and so Elven kind had enslave the trolls.  He, not smart by any standard, but smarter than most trolls, had turned the tables and spent every day since the last time he was in chains seeking the end to all elves.  Isaac shrugged, \"I say the Hoarde not care about little dead boy\u2026 All Elves in one place.\"  He grinned, \"Let's kill Elves.\"  The roar that answered him shook the ground.    Fiona's ears were bent back beside her head, her hair jet black and her eyes as red as any vampires. She hissed between words, dodging the spears, swords and fists clamouring for her head.  She chanted steadily, the ground beneath her playing parlay with her will, rocks and pebbles tearing free of their home and ripping through her enemies as she spoke.  She disregarded the number of enemies, if she allowed herself to think about it, depression would overwhelm her. She stood, barely a hundred meters out the front of the School's towering gates, surrounded by an army of stone, and accompanied by a half-dragon warlock, who surpassed all her expectations.  She had known that Bellum Draco was powerful, almost beyond compare.  But the truth was more than that.  When he called up a hurricane, it engulfed the entire island upon which the School sat, but the deftness of the magic was apparent, with the wind only affecting those that fought against the School. When fire raced from his hands, it was like a spirit of nature itself, racing through enemies, engulfing and incinerating them like a bushfire.  He was terrifying to behold.  As for herself, she threw pebbles by the dozens, turning them into deadly projectiles by throwing them in a spray at a speed that no one could match.  Beside her shields and swords clashed, the ground shaking with the heavy foot falls of the stone soldiers as they fought their part.  Blood bled across the ground, the blue of the elves mingling with the black of vampires. Traces of dust and stone mingled with the mess, spreading out in front of her, turning a once beautiful landscape into nothing more than a warzone.  Fiona could feel herself losing her grip on the world, could feel survival instincts kicking in, turning her into a monster that would kill. Destroy everything in sight.  She couldn't think straight, she didn't have the time to.  Despite the number of fallen, and the army fighting beside her, she was outnumbered twenty to one at the very least. It was driving her mad.  It didn't matter how many she killed, there was no respite. Spell after spell, weapon after weapon reached out to drag her down to her grave.    The general in charge of the Malatic Army was a well kept man. His hair was cropped short to his head, his armour perfectly arranged. His eyes were sharp, and his intellect keen.  General Damien Haralson was sitting in a chair, inside a tent, the wind blowing loudly outside, smoking a pipe. In his hands was a map, rapidly flashing.  Though he had no magic of his own, this map had been devised by him, and he was glad that he had.  It revealed the locations and current actions of every magic user around the School of History and Magic, updated constantly, allowing him to watch the battle as it was currently unfolding.  To be honest with himself, Haralson was slightly confused.  The vampiric forces launching themselves at the castle alone should have been bringing down the walls, let alone the aid that the Elven Kingdom was lending to them.  Very few magical forces could be seen at all.  A dozen mages on the walls, and two by the gates.  He could see evidence of non-magic wielders as well, by the number falling near the gates, and how those that vanished had little to do with the magic users located there.  Some sort of ground force.  Yet, as to the other defences, it seemed the few on the walls were responsible for the havoc playing out.  It was astonishing.  Haralson glanced up, laying the map neatly in his lap as a soldier burst in, dressed in a dancing yellow and green pattern. The spy gulped in air, and Haralson nodded, \"What is it?\"  \"The Troll Hoarde is\u2026\" He gulped in air, \"Half a mile up the hill.\"  Haralson looked down at the map, placing them in his mind, \"What threat do you think they pose? Any real guards?\"  The spy winced, \"They're packing up to move. From what I managed to hear, they aren't going for the school.\"  Haralson laughed in surprise, \"Taking the elves\u2026 That's a smart move if they really want all elves extinct\u2026 Who is their leader?\"  \"Isaac Isaac.\"  Haralson stared at the spy, \"He's here, himself? Hells bells\u2026 Let's try and stay out of their way.\"    The nymph swore violently as a bolt of lightning struck.  She was thrown into the air, a cascade of rocks slamming into her at full force, and she pushed the control of the circle to one of the professors, gripping her wand tight, as she felt herself begin to fall.  As Abigail plummeted downwards, her vision a swirl of sky, filled with screaming vampires, and ground covered in elvish warriors, she realised that the part of the wall where she had been standing was gone.  She was falling towards the ground.  The bastards had actually managed to get the drop on her.  Her grip tightened on the wand in her hand, and she twirled it, twisting reality, feeling it bending, breathing, and she let loose her will.  The wind around her took on life, and she felt herself slow as the two spirits of wind held her, lowering her gently to the ground.  She rubbed the dirt on her face, glaring out from beside the wall, at the elves staring at her.  There had to be hundreds of them, staring at her.  She swallowed, it was one on to thousands.  Abigail let loose a blood-curdling scream, her scales flaring outwards, and she flicked her wand forward, launching a hex outwards in a wave, traumatising bone, tearing limbs, blistering faces.  The elves rushed towards her.    Emmanuel Andrews strode forward, his eyes darting left and right as tents and fires sprang up around him. Cooks dashed to and fro, as soldiers checked their weapons and armour. Smiths were lighting their forges, and sharpening steel on their grindstones.  He smiled as he passed, thanking a cook here, encouraging a soldier here.  Emmanuel understood the importance of morale, and he knew that it would be the make-or-break on this battlefield. Though his field of vision was limited by the night beginning to close in, he could see the siege on the school ahead, illuminated by the many fires, and he was not envious of those already engaged.  The Prime Minister of Balsa had sent him with this army to establish a foothold, and ensure the destruction of Kyle Kilroy's body before he awoke as a Necromancer.  From what he could see, and what his spies had reported, this was an arm's race.  Most here wanted the same, but old scores would be settled.  Trolls, vampires, elves and humans.  This was going to be a bloodbath, whether he wanted it to be or not.    General Antonio Guerra slammed the metal spike into the ground, erecting the blood red banner, embossed with a golden phoenix, into the ground.  He looked out at the battlefield, smiling grimly.  Behind him the efficiency of the New Roman army had already finished establishing the camp, guards and spies already in place.  He knew the delicacy of the situation however, and the precarious situation he found himself in, leading these men to war.  The chance for in-fighting and ticking off the wrong people\u2026 He sighed and looked over at a young nearby boy, a messenger.  \"Write this: As General Guerra of the New Roman Empire, I humbly beg audience with King Applesilver, of the last Elven Kingdom, to discuss a combination of efforts and evaluation of an alliance in the destruction of the potential Necromancer.\" He nodded, \"Get one of the eagles to send it.\"  He turned back, looking out at the night with distrust.  This was a war, and with this many sides in one place\u2026 It was certain to go downhill quickly.",

            "text": "Chapter Eight\n\n\n\n\nBateman swore, leaping from the wall, surrounding himself in flames as he fell.\n\n\nHe hit the ground rolling, a stream of fire spewing from his mouth, searing skin and scorching armour, making the elves scream as they recoiled.\n\n\nHe sent a twist of air, striking a spear from an elf's hand, the point barely nicking the edge of Abigail's throat.\n\n\nShe sat frozen as he fought to get to her, swearing violently between his spells, fear etching itself into her every feature.\n\n\nHe grabbed her hand and hauled her upright, \"That was too close.\"\n\n\nHe turned and waved, \"Nunc creata wall flammae! Nunc creata wall flammae!\"\n\n\nA wall of flame shot out, knocking the elves backwards, \"I'm letting you die yet, Abigail.\"\n\n\nThe nymph swallowed, \"I nearly died.\"\n\n\n\"Yep.\" Bateman said, glaring at the cautious elves, \"But not today.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled weakly, readying her wand uncertainly, \"At least Kyle's a Necromancer.\"\n\n\n\"He's not yet.\" Bateman said, and shot an intrigued look sideways, \"He your boyfriend?\"\n\n\nThe nymph blushed, her scaled body turning purple for a moment, \"Not\u2026 Yet.\"\n\n\nBateman chanted, spraying flames out, glaring, and then laughed, \"Got some competition? A certain\u2026 Elf?\"\n\n\nAbigail roared, and the elves exploded from the inside out as their organs became too big for their bodies, \"Kyle can make his own choices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrolls can't creep.\n\n\nThat's just a fact - When you're made of stone and tower over most of the creatures in the world, some trolls even being mistaken for mountains, then the sneak attack is out of the question.\n\n\nYou can ambush, but not when your enemy is in place before you are.\n\n\nSo Isaac did the next best thing.\n\n\nHe approached the elvish encampment in full view, two trolls strolling behind him, looking angry and fierce, but under his control.\n\n\nAn Elvish guard raised an enchanted spear, glaring, \"Halt! You have no business here, troll.\"\n\n\nThe last word was spat, like a swear word, a word that you didn't say in front of friends or family.\n\n\nIsaac shrugged, creaking and cracking, \"That is not for you to say, little elf. I am Isaac Isaac, leader of Troll Hoarde. I want speak to\u2026 King\u2026 Applesilver.\"\n\n\nIt was hard to call that murderous scum of the earth a king, but he had to make a show. He had to make them believe he was a politician.\n\n\nThe elf glared at him, \"You're a troll. Who the hell cares what you want?\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac crouched, looking into the eyes of the elf, \"Why would I speak to one of your kind?\"\n\n\nThe elf blinked, realising how deep into trouble he was treading, the amount of politics that would come crashing down on his head, and he turned, creating a wisp of wind, and sent it away.\n\n\nThe guard smiled tightly, \"I've sent word. I can't allow you into the camp, till I am ordered.\"\n\n\nIsaac shrugged and sat down cross-legged, \"I am troll. I wait.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe could feel his other nature, the one he was ashamed of, the one that was his heritage and power, beginning to overwhelm him.\n\n\nThe nature of a dragon is death and destruction, they revel in it, rage empowering their very essence.\n\n\nIt was beginning to creep free of Bellum's grip.\n\n\nHe had thought that the school might have been able to protect Kilroy\u2026 But now?\n\n\nThis was pure insanity.\n\n\nFlames and ice poured out against him, as spear and arrows hailed down from every angle. He moved fluidly between wards and attacks, struggling to counter the many spells thrown at him.\n\n\nCountering a spell is simple - it doesn't require any incantation, only willpower. You had to convince the spell that it was wrong, and that it was already striking its target.\n\n\nCountering forty or fifty spells at once?\n\n\nDraco was at his wits end.\n\n\nHe felt a roar ripping free of his throat, his back began to arch, and the ground shook violently, nature rebelling against the travesty happening around it.\n\n\nThe half-dragon glared out at his enemies, his eyes bathed in a luminescent yellow, as the scales crept over him, hiding what little humanity he had left, and Draco felt the roar of the dragon, the cry within his soul, and nature responded. Reality bent, and the voice of the dragon twisted the world, tearing through it like it was nothing more than a piece of cloth.\n\n\nThe army in front of him burst into flames, reeling in confusion and chaos, and the hurricane swept them back, tossing aside the meagre few willing to risk their lives against him as nothing more than ash.\n\n\nYet\u2026 Something felt wrong.\n\n\nHe was still human.\n\n\nBellum cried in pain, falling to his knees and he dragged himself out of the pit of emotions that was a dragon's mind, and he gasped, breathing hard, as the scales tore free, leaving the half-human man lying on his knees, weak and unarmoured.\n\n\nHe stared around blearily, fighting back the tears of pain, and then he felt a slow trickle of fear as he saw eight stone warriors in a circle, around a small crumpled form.\n\n\nHe sprinted over, falling the last few meters, and stared down at the girl, his hand going under her head and lifting it, \"No, no, no, no\u2026\"\n\n\nHe felt no pulse, and as he pulled her eyes open, the pupils failed to respond.\n\n\nBellum winced, muttering quickly, \"Spirant altum, et impleant eas pulmonis cum instancia!\"\n\n\nAir pushed itself into her body, making her breath again, and he bit his bottom lip.\n\n\nIf he left, then the gates would lie undefended, but without Fiona, he couldn't hope to hold off the armies attacking, not for long. The school would fall.\n\n\nHe winced, \"Sound the retreat. Get everyone inside the school. They win this round.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe elvish king turned with a heavy glare as the messenger he had sent appeared, breathing raggedly, covered from head to toe in blood.\n\n\nKing Applesilver stared at him in surprise, \"What the hell is happening out there?\"\n\n\nThe messenger swallowed, holding his side, blood pouring over the wound, \"The trolls. They've attacked.\"\n\n\nHe winced.\n\n\nHe had noticed his men vanishing from the back of the encampment, and expected some level of treachery, but this was not it.\n\n\nHe'd expected the vampires to start picking off his elves, but trolls? Since when did they have the imagination to change the reason they were attacking, let alone devise a strategy that invited enemies to attempt to attack them.\n\n\nApplesilver winced, looking at the messenger, knowing he was moments from death, \"Is Isaac here?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, sir. He led them.\"\n\n\nAt least that bit of the invitation that had only just reached him wasn't a lie.\n\n\nHe spoke quickly, seizing control of the blood pouring out from the man, using Aquamancy to turn it into a weapon, \"\"\n\n\nThe messenger collapsed to the ground, dead, and Applesilver punched the table in front of him in frustration. How was he supposed to direct a war against the School of History and Magic with the Troll Hoarde breathing down his neck?\n\n\nHe turned, glaring at another waiting messenger, \"Go to New Rome, their general is Antonio Guerra. Tell him this: I, King Applesilver, humbly beg the assistance of New Rome, and I will remain in your debt if you choose to accept. We have been attacked by the Troll Hoarde, and cannot fight both these fronts.\"\n\n\nHe turned back to his map, \"Go quick, kid\u2026 The war rests on it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaralson looked at the messenger, a well-trained and battled soldier, one who had seen more than his fair share of blades and magic.\n\n\nHe nodded, \"You will need to be careful. Trolls are slow in intellect, so they have developed a habit of obliterating that which they don't comprehend. And they can.\"\n\n\nThe man nodded, \"Yes, milord.\"\n\n\nHaralson sighed, \"Try and speak only directly with Isaac Isaac, their leader. Don't ask for their king. Trolls don't like kings\u2026 The message should be simple, but you may need to explain it, slowly and with basic words, without trying to make the trolls feel stupid. If they feel like you are treating them like idiots\u2026 They'll roast you alive and eat you.\"\n\n\nThe soldier nodded again and Haralson rubbed his face, \"Tell Isaac Isaac, that General Haralson from Malata wants to be friends. He wants Malata and the Troll Hoarde not to fight, and will be happy to fight the elves, if Isaac Isaac wants that. We want to be friends.\"\n\n\nThe messenger nodded and Haralson smiled, \"That's it, go. Be careful\u2026 That's a warzone, and they are trolls.\"\n\n\nHe turned his attention back to the map in his hands, smiling as he saw the elves numbers being decimated by the trolls, and then he blinked in surprise.\n\n\nWhere there had been a wide curve of endless death in front of the school gates, there was now a mass of elves, presumably assaulting the gates themselves.\n\n\nThere was a small cluster of mages inside the gates, but presumably their attentions were on solidifying the gates, not attacking the army that was nearly breaching the walls.\n\n\nThe School of History and Magic had had their bluff called - unless they handed over Kyle Kilroy's body for destruction\u2026 The school may as well never have existed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndre smiled toothily, perching on the edge of a tower overlooking the school, his shadowy form blending into the long-casted shadows of the midday sun, but his attention was no longer focused on the school.\n\n\nHe could see chaos erupting within the elvish encampment, the towering figures of trolls throwing themselves through it at speed, swing trees like clubs, crushing the elves, and for all intents and purposes, ignoring the magic hurled at them.\n\n\nHe knew what it meant of course - Isaac Isaac, the smartest troll to have ever lived, was leading the charge, and he had decided that Kilroy was less of a threat than the elves.\n\n\nIf he could wipe out the elvish army here, then the few defences around the elvish kingdom itself would prove weak, and they could extinguish the species altogether.\n\n\nHe laughed, it was a just turn of events.\n\n\nBut one that he doubted the trolls could actually pull off by themselves\u2026\n\n\nThe vampire screeched, taking to the air, flinging himself forward faster than any arrow could move, tapping the shoulders of his generals as he shot like an arrow towards the elvish encampment.\n\n\nThe flock flying and diving above the wall slowly swirled out above him, as his commands took root, and the swarms of vampires that sat in the sky like thunderclouds dropped as one, launching themselves into the elves.\n\n\nAndre hit the ground at speed, easily avoiding a startled elf, snapping his neck before the man could draw his sword. The next man screamed as his spine was torn free in a fluid movement before he could even grasp the situation.\n\n\nSomewhere nearby came the twang of a bow, and Andre rolled his eyes as he ran, grabbing the arrow streaking for his chest, spinning it and plunging it into the archer's eye, and out the back of the woman's head.\n\n\nHe paused as he entered a white tent, with golden embroidery, and he laughed at the angry elvish king, standing there staring at his map in frustration.\n\n\nAs Andre waited to be noticed, he saw half of the magical figures standing on the map turn to smoke.\n\n\nApplesilver jerked his head up, glaring, \"Vampire.\"\n\n\nAndre shrugged, dodging a sword from behind, grabbing it, bending the sword and wrapped it around the bodyguard's neck, choking him to death. \"Applesilver, surely you recognise your old friend.\"\n\n\nThe Elvish king sneered, \"You think you can stop me, vampire?\"\n\n\nAndre laughed, his fangs protruding, \"I am well aware of your skill with Aquamancy, King Applesilver. Just like I am aware you can manipulate the liquids within someone's body, a skill most would kill you for.\"\n\n\nApplesilver clenched his fists, \"Flecte quod est corpus, et adorabunt me ipsum!\"\n\n\nAndre scratched his cheek, \"Really? You're going to try and make me bow at your feet?\"\n\n\nThe vampire glared, claws lengthening, \"I have no blood in my system, Applesilver. Neither does a single one in my army. It's one of my rules, since you tried to wipe us all out. We don't feed whilst we fight.\"\n\n\nFear began to dawn on the elf's face, the indignation fading to be replaced with resignation, \"You're going to kill me.\"\n\n\nAndre shook his head, \"I would love to. I would love to make all elves a thing of the past, an extinct creature of myth. So I can track down and destroy everyone who speaks of elves. Give it a century or two, and no one will even believe you ever existed.\"\n\n\nThe vampire shrugged, \"I'm sure most of my generals would recommend that action.\"\n\n\nKing Applesilver blinked, staring, \"But?\"\n\n\n\"You and your family line are quite delicious.\" Andre said with a grin, \"As I recall\u2026 Also\u2026 The last king of the elves. That is a bargaining chip that we could use a dozen times over.\"\n\n\nAnother vampire appeared inside the room with a flash, and Andre nodded, \"Wipe them out. Only one survivor. King Applesilver. Exterminate the rest.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The vampire spoke, and before the last syllable had finished sounding, he was gone.\n\n\nAndre placed a clawed hand against Applesilver's head, \"Now then\u2026 How much torture have you endured in your past?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntonio Guerra stood at the top of a hill, a man holding a banner to his left, and a single broadsword was in his hands, he called out loudly, \"Trolls! Cease your attack!\"\n\n\nHe saw a couple turn to look, one scratched his head, \"What does little man want?\"\n\n\n\"You will stop your attack, or you will die.\" Antonio said, raising his sword, both hands gripping the leather handle firmly, and the troll laughed, \"What does two little men do to trolls.\"\n\n\nAntonio smiled, \"Attack.\"\n\n\nA hundred horseman crested the horizon from behind him, charging into the fray without halting. Some swept elves up as they went by, others launched projectiles at the trolls, targeting their eyes.\n\n\nHe hefted his sword and charged down the hill, feeling the thundering footsteps of a thousand foot soldiers behind him. He skidded beneath a slot troll fist, dodging to the left as it tried to walk around to crush him, and he sliced his sword across an ankle, hearing it scream.\n\n\nThe screaming continued as the soldiers behind him followed suit, and then a length of chain was wrapped around the troll's feet, causing it to fall.\n\n\nThe screams cut off as its throat was cut.\n\n\nHe danced the dance of battle, smiling as he moved, his blade precise, wasting no strength or endurance, his men an efficient machine of destruction.\n\n\nHe paused as he saw a captain's badge on a nearby elf, \"King Applesilver sends his regards.\"\n\n\nThe captain shook his head, \"I'm hearing worse things than the trolls, Roman, though you most welcome.\"\n\n\nAntonio frowned, \"The vampires? They've started hitting the camp?\"\n\n\nThe captain nodded and Antonio grinned, \"They're not much of a worry for us.\"\n\n\nHe tapped his armour and smiled, \"Enchanted with the sun. Not much different in appearance\u2026 But every New Roman soldier has been trained and equipped to fight vampires. We'll win this camp back.\"\n\n\nThe elvish captain smiled, \"I wish I shared your enthusiasm.\"\n\n\nAntonio waved a hand round, \"Look around. Within two minutes of our arrival, your men are safe. Together? We can break the skulls of a few monsters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail swallowed nervously, \"This suddenly got harder.\"\n\n\nBateman nodded, sweat pouring off the professor, \"Where the hell did our support go?\"\n\n\nAbigail glared, twisting as she made the ground come alive, grabbing and eating a dozen elves, before another mage undid her spell. \"I still have my link to the circle, so I'm guessing the gate has fallen.\"\n\n\nBateman glanced over at her, \"Then Bellum Draco is dead.\"\n\n\n\"That might explain why they have a thousand spare elves to kill us two.\"\n\n\nHe winced, glaring at the battlefield, as fire stretched forward from his wand, \"I'm not sure we can do this anymore.\"\n\n\nAbigail laughed bitterly, \"Yep. So now we leave.\"\n\n\nShe spun, flicking her wrist, and the wall became alive, opening a mouth as tall as she was, the grabbed Bateman and plunged through it, as it snapped its teeth shut behind her.\n\n\nThey collapsed onto the cobbled stone street, and Abigail flicked her wrist again, the life leaving the wall.\n\n\nShe lay on the ground breathing hard, looking up at the sky, \"Huh\u2026 No vampires.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can't do anymore.\" Professor Maidr said sadly, looking at the young elf lying on a stretcher, just inside the gate.\n\n\nDraco looked down at the girl, tears welling in his eyes.\n\n\nHe had put her in this danger\u2026 Put them all in danger.\n\n\nHe should have tried to stop all this when it was just a few assassins looking for Kilroy's head\u2026 Because of his failure to act, and his own stubbornness, a remarkable girl lay dying at his feet.\n\n\nMaidr had stopped the bleeding, but the gaping holes where her throat used to be revealed the tactless and off-hand way in which a vampire had tried to remove Fiona Applesilver from the world.\n\n\nShe was a remarkable woman - in every way.\n\n\nBarely an adolescent by elvish standards, and she understood war and politics better than most humans ever would. She had stood and fought for beliefs that were not her own, and triumphed.\n\n\nShe manipulated and used a magic that made her an outcast, and instead of rebelling against her nature, and refusing to use her magic, instead she had revelled in it, surpassing most who would attempt to learn Terramancy.\n\n\nA tear dripped from his haggard face, landing on the young girl, and he brushed it away, his hand leaving a stain of blood, \"I failed you\u2026 I am so, so sorry\u2026 Fiona\u2026\"\n\n\nHe put his head in his hands, her life was on him.\n\n\nHe'd let her die.\n\n\nHe'd failed to keep his nature under control, and so he hadn't seen her as a partner or comrade, instead he hadn't seen her at all.\n\n\nEven if the vampire hadn't struck her down, his own magic would have killed her in the end.\n\n\nShe was rare - a thing of beauty, a pure hearted woman.\n\n\nSolid, dependable and far too headstrong.\n\n\nBut\u2026\n\n\nShe was gone.\n\n\nThe half-dragon Headmaster stood and turned to the gate, tears in his eyes.\n\n\nFiona Applesilver was dead.",

            "text": "Bateman swore, leaping from the wall, surrounding himself in flames as he fell.  He hit the ground rolling, a stream of fire spewing from his mouth, searing skin and scorching armour, making the elves scream as they recoiled.  He sent a twist of air, striking a spear from an elf's hand, the point barely nicking the edge of Abigail's throat.  She sat frozen as he fought to get to her, swearing violently between his spells, fear etching itself into her every feature.  He grabbed her hand and hauled her upright, \"That was too close.\"  He turned and waved, \"Nunc creata wall flammae! Nunc creata wall flammae!\"  A wall of flame shot out, knocking the elves backwards, \"I'm letting you die yet, Abigail.\"  The nymph swallowed, \"I nearly died.\"  \"Yep.\" Bateman said, glaring at the cautious elves, \"But not today.\"  Abigail smiled weakly, readying her wand uncertainly, \"At least Kyle's a Necromancer.\"  \"He's not yet.\" Bateman said, and shot an intrigued look sideways, \"He your boyfriend?\"  The nymph blushed, her scaled body turning purple for a moment, \"Not\u2026 Yet.\"  Bateman chanted, spraying flames out, glaring, and then laughed, \"Got some competition? A certain\u2026 Elf?\"  Abigail roared, and the elves exploded from the inside out as their organs became too big for their bodies, \"Kyle can make his own choices.\"    Trolls can't creep.  That's just a fact - When you're made of stone and tower over most of the creatures in the world, some trolls even being mistaken for mountains, then the sneak attack is out of the question.  You can ambush, but not when your enemy is in place before you are.  So Isaac did the next best thing.  He approached the elvish encampment in full view, two trolls strolling behind him, looking angry and fierce, but under his control.  An Elvish guard raised an enchanted spear, glaring, \"Halt! You have no business here, troll.\"  The last word was spat, like a swear word, a word that you didn't say in front of friends or family.  Isaac shrugged, creaking and cracking, \"That is not for you to say, little elf. I am Isaac Isaac, leader of Troll Hoarde. I want speak to\u2026 King\u2026 Applesilver.\"  It was hard to call that murderous scum of the earth a king, but he had to make a show. He had to make them believe he was a politician.  The elf glared at him, \"You're a troll. Who the hell cares what you want?\"  Isaac Isaac crouched, looking into the eyes of the elf, \"Why would I speak to one of your kind?\"  The elf blinked, realising how deep into trouble he was treading, the amount of politics that would come crashing down on his head, and he turned, creating a wisp of wind, and sent it away.  The guard smiled tightly, \"I've sent word. I can't allow you into the camp, till I am ordered.\"  Isaac shrugged and sat down cross-legged, \"I am troll. I wait.\"    He could feel his other nature, the one he was ashamed of, the one that was his heritage and power, beginning to overwhelm him.  The nature of a dragon is death and destruction, they revel in it, rage empowering their very essence.  It was beginning to creep free of Bellum's grip.  He had thought that the school might have been able to protect Kilroy\u2026 But now?  This was pure insanity.  Flames and ice poured out against him, as spear and arrows hailed down from every angle. He moved fluidly between wards and attacks, struggling to counter the many spells thrown at him.  Countering a spell is simple - it doesn't require any incantation, only willpower. You had to convince the spell that it was wrong, and that it was already striking its target.  Countering forty or fifty spells at once?  Draco was at his wits end.  He felt a roar ripping free of his throat, his back began to arch, and the ground shook violently, nature rebelling against the travesty happening around it.  The half-dragon glared out at his enemies, his eyes bathed in a luminescent yellow, as the scales crept over him, hiding what little humanity he had left, and Draco felt the roar of the dragon, the cry within his soul, and nature responded. Reality bent, and the voice of the dragon twisted the world, tearing through it like it was nothing more than a piece of cloth.  The army in front of him burst into flames, reeling in confusion and chaos, and the hurricane swept them back, tossing aside the meagre few willing to risk their lives against him as nothing more than ash.  Yet\u2026 Something felt wrong.  He was still human.  Bellum cried in pain, falling to his knees and he dragged himself out of the pit of emotions that was a dragon's mind, and he gasped, breathing hard, as the scales tore free, leaving the half-human man lying on his knees, weak and unarmoured.  He stared around blearily, fighting back the tears of pain, and then he felt a slow trickle of fear as he saw eight stone warriors in a circle, around a small crumpled form.  He sprinted over, falling the last few meters, and stared down at the girl, his hand going under her head and lifting it, \"No, no, no, no\u2026\"  He felt no pulse, and as he pulled her eyes open, the pupils failed to respond.  Bellum winced, muttering quickly, \"Spirant altum, et impleant eas pulmonis cum instancia!\"  Air pushed itself into her body, making her breath again, and he bit his bottom lip.  If he left, then the gates would lie undefended, but without Fiona, he couldn't hope to hold off the armies attacking, not for long. The school would fall.  He winced, \"Sound the retreat. Get everyone inside the school. They win this round.\"    The elvish king turned with a heavy glare as the messenger he had sent appeared, breathing raggedly, covered from head to toe in blood.  King Applesilver stared at him in surprise, \"What the hell is happening out there?\"  The messenger swallowed, holding his side, blood pouring over the wound, \"The trolls. They've attacked.\"  He winced.  He had noticed his men vanishing from the back of the encampment, and expected some level of treachery, but this was not it.  He'd expected the vampires to start picking off his elves, but trolls? Since when did they have the imagination to change the reason they were attacking, let alone devise a strategy that invited enemies to attempt to attack them.  Applesilver winced, looking at the messenger, knowing he was moments from death, \"Is Isaac here?\"  \"Yes, sir. He led them.\"  At least that bit of the invitation that had only just reached him wasn't a lie.  He spoke quickly, seizing control of the blood pouring out from the man, using Aquamancy to turn it into a weapon, \"\"  The messenger collapsed to the ground, dead, and Applesilver punched the table in front of him in frustration. How was he supposed to direct a war against the School of History and Magic with the Troll Hoarde breathing down his neck?  He turned, glaring at another waiting messenger, \"Go to New Rome, their general is Antonio Guerra. Tell him this: I, King Applesilver, humbly beg the assistance of New Rome, and I will remain in your debt if you choose to accept. We have been attacked by the Troll Hoarde, and cannot fight both these fronts.\"  He turned back to his map, \"Go quick, kid\u2026 The war rests on it.\"    Haralson looked at the messenger, a well-trained and battled soldier, one who had seen more than his fair share of blades and magic.  He nodded, \"You will need to be careful. Trolls are slow in intellect, so they have developed a habit of obliterating that which they don't comprehend. And they can.\"  The man nodded, \"Yes, milord.\"  Haralson sighed, \"Try and speak only directly with Isaac Isaac, their leader. Don't ask for their king. Trolls don't like kings\u2026 The message should be simple, but you may need to explain it, slowly and with basic words, without trying to make the trolls feel stupid. If they feel like you are treating them like idiots\u2026 They'll roast you alive and eat you.\"  The soldier nodded again and Haralson rubbed his face, \"Tell Isaac Isaac, that General Haralson from Malata wants to be friends. He wants Malata and the Troll Hoarde not to fight, and will be happy to fight the elves, if Isaac Isaac wants that. We want to be friends.\"  The messenger nodded and Haralson smiled, \"That's it, go. Be careful\u2026 That's a warzone, and they are trolls.\"  He turned his attention back to the map in his hands, smiling as he saw the elves numbers being decimated by the trolls, and then he blinked in surprise.  Where there had been a wide curve of endless death in front of the school gates, there was now a mass of elves, presumably assaulting the gates themselves.  There was a small cluster of mages inside the gates, but presumably their attentions were on solidifying the gates, not attacking the army that was nearly breaching the walls.  The School of History and Magic had had their bluff called - unless they handed over Kyle Kilroy's body for destruction\u2026 The school may as well never have existed.    Andre smiled toothily, perching on the edge of a tower overlooking the school, his shadowy form blending into the long-casted shadows of the midday sun, but his attention was no longer focused on the school.  He could see chaos erupting within the elvish encampment, the towering figures of trolls throwing themselves through it at speed, swing trees like clubs, crushing the elves, and for all intents and purposes, ignoring the magic hurled at them.  He knew what it meant of course - Isaac Isaac, the smartest troll to have ever lived, was leading the charge, and he had decided that Kilroy was less of a threat than the elves.  If he could wipe out the elvish army here, then the few defences around the elvish kingdom itself would prove weak, and they could extinguish the species altogether.  He laughed, it was a just turn of events.  But one that he doubted the trolls could actually pull off by themselves\u2026  The vampire screeched, taking to the air, flinging himself forward faster than any arrow could move, tapping the shoulders of his generals as he shot like an arrow towards the elvish encampment.  The flock flying and diving above the wall slowly swirled out above him, as his commands took root, and the swarms of vampires that sat in the sky like thunderclouds dropped as one, launching themselves into the elves.  Andre hit the ground at speed, easily avoiding a startled elf, snapping his neck before the man could draw his sword. The next man screamed as his spine was torn free in a fluid movement before he could even grasp the situation.  Somewhere nearby came the twang of a bow, and Andre rolled his eyes as he ran, grabbing the arrow streaking for his chest, spinning it and plunging it into the archer's eye, and out the back of the woman's head.  He paused as he entered a white tent, with golden embroidery, and he laughed at the angry elvish king, standing there staring at his map in frustration.  As Andre waited to be noticed, he saw half of the magical figures standing on the map turn to smoke.  Applesilver jerked his head up, glaring, \"Vampire.\"  Andre shrugged, dodging a sword from behind, grabbing it, bending the sword and wrapped it around the bodyguard's neck, choking him to death. \"Applesilver, surely you recognise your old friend.\"  The Elvish king sneered, \"You think you can stop me, vampire?\"  Andre laughed, his fangs protruding, \"I am well aware of your skill with Aquamancy, King Applesilver. Just like I am aware you can manipulate the liquids within someone's body, a skill most would kill you for.\"  Applesilver clenched his fists, \"Flecte quod est corpus, et adorabunt me ipsum!\"  Andre scratched his cheek, \"Really? You're going to try and make me bow at your feet?\"  The vampire glared, claws lengthening, \"I have no blood in my system, Applesilver. Neither does a single one in my army. It's one of my rules, since you tried to wipe us all out. We don't feed whilst we fight.\"  Fear began to dawn on the elf's face, the indignation fading to be replaced with resignation, \"You're going to kill me.\"  Andre shook his head, \"I would love to. I would love to make all elves a thing of the past, an extinct creature of myth. So I can track down and destroy everyone who speaks of elves. Give it a century or two, and no one will even believe you ever existed.\"  The vampire shrugged, \"I'm sure most of my generals would recommend that action.\"  King Applesilver blinked, staring, \"But?\"  \"You and your family line are quite delicious.\" Andre said with a grin, \"As I recall\u2026 Also\u2026 The last king of the elves. That is a bargaining chip that we could use a dozen times over.\"  Another vampire appeared inside the room with a flash, and Andre nodded, \"Wipe them out. Only one survivor. King Applesilver. Exterminate the rest.\"  \"Yes, sir.\" The vampire spoke, and before the last syllable had finished sounding, he was gone.  Andre placed a clawed hand against Applesilver's head, \"Now then\u2026 How much torture have you endured in your past?\"    Antonio Guerra stood at the top of a hill, a man holding a banner to his left, and a single broadsword was in his hands, he called out loudly, \"Trolls! Cease your attack!\"  He saw a couple turn to look, one scratched his head, \"What does little man want?\"  \"You will stop your attack, or you will die.\" Antonio said, raising his sword, both hands gripping the leather handle firmly, and the troll laughed, \"What does two little men do to trolls.\"  Antonio smiled, \"Attack.\"  A hundred horseman crested the horizon from behind him, charging into the fray without halting. Some swept elves up as they went by, others launched projectiles at the trolls, targeting their eyes.  He hefted his sword and charged down the hill, feeling the thundering footsteps of a thousand foot soldiers behind him. He skidded beneath a slot troll fist, dodging to the left as it tried to walk around to crush him, and he sliced his sword across an ankle, hearing it scream.  The screaming continued as the soldiers behind him followed suit, and then a length of chain was wrapped around the troll's feet, causing it to fall.  The screams cut off as its throat was cut.  He danced the dance of battle, smiling as he moved, his blade precise, wasting no strength or endurance, his men an efficient machine of destruction.  He paused as he saw a captain's badge on a nearby elf, \"King Applesilver sends his regards.\"  The captain shook his head, \"I'm hearing worse things than the trolls, Roman, though you most welcome.\"  Antonio frowned, \"The vampires? They've started hitting the camp?\"  The captain nodded and Antonio grinned, \"They're not much of a worry for us.\"  He tapped his armour and smiled, \"Enchanted with the sun. Not much different in appearance\u2026 But every New Roman soldier has been trained and equipped to fight vampires. We'll win this camp back.\"  The elvish captain smiled, \"I wish I shared your enthusiasm.\"  Antonio waved a hand round, \"Look around. Within two minutes of our arrival, your men are safe. Together? We can break the skulls of a few monsters.\"    Abigail swallowed nervously, \"This suddenly got harder.\"  Bateman nodded, sweat pouring off the professor, \"Where the hell did our support go?\"  Abigail glared, twisting as she made the ground come alive, grabbing and eating a dozen elves, before another mage undid her spell. \"I still have my link to the circle, so I'm guessing the gate has fallen.\"  Bateman glanced over at her, \"Then Bellum Draco is dead.\"  \"That might explain why they have a thousand spare elves to kill us two.\"  He winced, glaring at the battlefield, as fire stretched forward from his wand, \"I'm not sure we can do this anymore.\"  Abigail laughed bitterly, \"Yep. So now we leave.\"  She spun, flicking her wrist, and the wall became alive, opening a mouth as tall as she was, the grabbed Bateman and plunged through it, as it snapped its teeth shut behind her.  They collapsed onto the cobbled stone street, and Abigail flicked her wrist again, the life leaving the wall.  She lay on the ground breathing hard, looking up at the sky, \"Huh\u2026 No vampires.\"    \"I can't do anymore.\" Professor Maidr said sadly, looking at the young elf lying on a stretcher, just inside the gate.  Draco looked down at the girl, tears welling in his eyes.  He had put her in this danger\u2026 Put them all in danger.  He should have tried to stop all this when it was just a few assassins looking for Kilroy's head\u2026 Because of his failure to act, and his own stubbornness, a remarkable girl lay dying at his feet.  Maidr had stopped the bleeding, but the gaping holes where her throat used to be revealed the tactless and off-hand way in which a vampire had tried to remove Fiona Applesilver from the world.  She was a remarkable woman - in every way.  Barely an adolescent by elvish standards, and she understood war and politics better than most humans ever would. She had stood and fought for beliefs that were not her own, and triumphed.  She manipulated and used a magic that made her an outcast, and instead of rebelling against her nature, and refusing to use her magic, instead she had revelled in it, surpassing most who would attempt to learn Terramancy.  A tear dripped from his haggard face, landing on the young girl, and he brushed it away, his hand leaving a stain of blood, \"I failed you\u2026 I am so, so sorry\u2026 Fiona\u2026\"  He put his head in his hands, her life was on him.  He'd let her die.  He'd failed to keep his nature under control, and so he hadn't seen her as a partner or comrade, instead he hadn't seen her at all.  Even if the vampire hadn't struck her down, his own magic would have killed her in the end.  She was rare - a thing of beauty, a pure hearted woman.  Solid, dependable and far too headstrong.  But\u2026  She was gone.  The half-dragon Headmaster stood and turned to the gate, tears in his eyes.  Fiona Applesilver was dead.",

We need her at the front. Things are getting crazy.\"\n\n\nThe young Sanamancer winced, \"She's still down by the gate, dealing with the elf.\"\n\n\nAbigail's face went white, \"Fiona? Something happened to her?\"\n\n\nThe healer shrugged, \"I dunno.\"\n\n\nShe gritted her teeth and turned, limping as fast as she could.\n\n\nBateman spotted her near the entrance, \"So? Maidr there?\"\n\n\n\"No.\" Abigail swallowed, \"Something happened to Fi. Down at the gate.\"\n\n\nBateman looked at the Vitamancer and winced, \"Don't let those feelings overwhelm you. You're still linked to the Circle.\"\n\n\nAbigail nodded, fighting back tears, \"We have to get Maidr, and she's at the gate.\"\n\n\nThe professor walked beside her, supporting her, and he looked at her leg, noticing the black arrow sticking sideways out of her knee for the first time, \"When did that happen?\"\n\n\n\"Eighth or ninth wave of vampires.\" Abigail shrugged, wincing at the movement, \"I didn't really have time to pay attention to that sort of thing.\"\n\n\nBateman bit the inside of his cheek and she looked at him, \"Wait\u2026 Something wrong?\"\n\n\n\"Vampires use cursed arrows. If that doesn't get fixed soon\u2026 You're dead.\" The professor said hesitantly, fear in his voice, and Abigail ground her teeth together, \"If I ever see Kyle again, I'm killing him myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona stared wide-eyed at the world.\n\n\nIt seemed both blurry, and so focused that it hurt, at the same time.\n\n\nShe couldn't think straight, only one thought spinning around and around in her head, something was wrong.\n\n\nThe idea that something was wrong filled her, it was the strongest conviction she held in her life, but she couldn't work out what exactly was wrong.\n\n\nEvery time she tried, she was overwhelmed by the thought again, leaving her motionless, as the world blurred and moved around her.\n\n\nShe felt beyond dizzy, as if she could never come back from it, breathing only happened whenever she could focus all her energy on it.\n\n\nHowever, strange enough, she wasn't in any pain at all.\n\n\nThat was wrong.\n\n\nFiona sat bolt upright, and immediately she was stabbed with more pain than she had ever felt, every nerve in her body lighting up like a christmas tree, and she went to scream, but all that came out was a groan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndre pulled his hand out of the elf's chest, glaring at the vampire who was interrupting his torture, \"What is it?\"\n\n\nThe vampire winced, \"We've been attacked. The Troll Hoarde has been defeated.\"\n\n\nAndre glared, \"Say what?\"\n\n\n\"From their bloody insignia, it's New Rome.\" The vampire growled, and Andre's face fell, \"Damn it.\"\n\n\nHe swept the groaning and only half-alive King Applesilver onto his shoulder, \"Sound the retreat. I'm not fighting an army of Vampire Hunters today.\"\n\n\nHe ran across the ground, being careful of the whiplash, he didn't want the king to die before he could be useful. The man hadn't even had a chance to be any fun yet.\n\n\nHe leapt into the air, cruising above a cloud, before sharply turning and shooting out towards a distant mountain surrounded by a black thunderstorm.\n\n\nHe touched down onto the soil softly, and walked inside the cave, dumping King Applesilver in the infirmary, and looked around at the leaders of the other armies, \"New Rome has arrived. They decided to side with the elves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail spun a wave of magic at the wall of arrows falling over the gate towards the two professors and one prone form. They spun in the air, screeching and flew back towards the soldiers who had fired them.\n\n\nThe nymph glared over at the professors, \"What's the situation?\"\n\n\nMaidr winced, \"Abigail\u2026 You shouldn't be here.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster sighed and rubbed his face, \"She is now. I could use the backup. Holding that gate is getting\u2026 Problematic.\"\n\n\nAbigail walked over, looking down at the shivering and shaking figure of her friend, and she swallowed nervously. Fiona was soaked in sweat, her teeth chattered, and her eyes were constantly roaming - independently of each other.\n\n\nShe looked at Maidr in concern, \"What the hell happened?\"\n\n\nThe pixie looked at her sadly, \"There's nothing we can do, Abigail.\"\n\n\nShe felt anger hit her, and she yellowed, her scales flashing to a bright red, \"What happened!?\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster put a hand on her shoulder, \"Vampire attack. Tore out her throat, and infected her with some nasty vampire poison.\"\n\n\nHe jerked his attention skyward, \"Et sacrificate de caelo, nunc denuo in tenebris!\"\n\n\nThe sky blew up in flames for a moment, and he looked at her carefully, \"I need your help here, Miss Inglis. We're losing this war.\"\n\n\nAbigail glared at him, \"I need to help Fi.\"\n\n\n\"You can't!\" He roared, his voice changing pitch, and Abigail felt a tremble of fear as the low of his voice echoed through her. It felt\u2026 Wrong.\n\n\nShe shook her head, spinning her wand, \"I can do more than you think\u2026 Professor Maidr, what's the matter?\"\n\n\nThe pixie sighed heavily, \"She can't heal anymore. I've stopped the bleeding, but I can't form any scar tissue. So\u2026 Breathing is an issue. I'm keeping her alive\u2026 But I stop doing anything\u2026 She dies.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"I can do just about any Vitamancy.\"\n\n\nThe pixie shook her head, \"That's not going to help. It needs to be Sanamancy.\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"So\u2026 Link with me. Use my magic.\"\n\n\nThe pixie stared at her, \"Are you kidding? You need a circle of eight mages to form a circle. Always.\"\n\n\nThe nymph cocked her head, \"Kyle didn't.\"\n\n\nThe professor stared, \"Really? That's\u2026 Impossible.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster laughed as he finished another defensive spell, \"No\u2026 Only highly improbable. Now are you done wasting your time, Abigail?\"\n\n\nShe spun, launching herself at him, knocking the professor to the ground, jamming her wand up against his Adam's apple, \"I am not wasting my time!\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster glared at her, \"I tried to save Fiona.\"\n\n\nAbigail felt the anger flowing through her, the hatred, seeking a target, and she couldn't see a better one. She just wanted to see him die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general of the Balsa Army sat in a tree, eating an apple. \n\n\nBelow him, New Roman soldiers battle trolls, whilst vampires took the air and ran.\n\n\nAs for him and his army, they sat in the trees, waiting for the moment when the opportunity was best.\n\n\nHe wasn't an idiot.\n\n\nEmmanuel Andrews remembered the school quite well, and if the flames in the distance were anything to judge by, his old professor still stood strong and defended the school.\n\n\nBut even Bateman had his own weaknesses.\n\n\nAll he had to do was wait, and then he could melt the skin off of anyone who opposed him.\n\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\nUnlike the rest who were here, Balsa, as a nation, had decided that the death of Kyle Kilroy was not in their best interest.\n\n\nThey wanted to bring him back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were nine vampiric armies in the Shadowlands. Seven had come to destroy the abomination hidden behind a castle wall, defended by a thousand mages.\n\n\nThey shouldn't stand a chance, but so far, the School of History and Magic had been incredibly tenacious.\n\n\nThat being said, the fight they were putting up couldn't be said to be overwhelming. Their defeat was simply a matter of time.\n\n\nAndre's face grew dark, knowing that the resurrection of Kyle Kilroy was also simply a matter of time.\n\n\nThe young man, an Aimimancer, was incredibly dangerous, and far too clever for his own good.\n\n\nIt had been one of his subordinates that had killed Kyle's family, sloppily leaving the child alive.\n\n\nAndre had been forced to interfere, blank Kyle's mind and send him away, four times since the child had managed to save his own life with the dark magic that almost all vampires used as instinctively as an elf might control the elements... But meeting Kyle had changed Andre's mind on that one.\n\n\nKyle professed to be far from a master with Aimimancy, and yet he could cast spells with it better than a single person that Andre had ever seen.\n\n\nHe looked at the gathering of generals again and sighed, it fell to him to achieve the goals.\n\n\n\"We have captured King Applesilver, a bargaining chip against the elves, perhaps. But today, they are not our enemy. Removing them will simply strengthen the defences of the school. To win this war, all these armies must be united. Trolls, elves, humans and vampires. A unites front against Kyle Kilroy. We have different motivations, and this alliance will disintegrate the moment that his body is destroyed... But it must be done.\"\n\n\nThe other vampires looked at him in shock and revulsion, but Andre shrugged.\n\n\nHe had only spoken the truth, and as the night fell outside, he knew that they had to speed this war to its end, or Kilroy would end them all.",

            "text": "Abigail limped inside the infirmary, looking around, and spotted one of the younger Sanamancers healing a professor, and grabbed her, \"Where's Maidr? We need her at the front. Things are getting crazy.\"  The young Sanamancer winced, \"She's still down by the gate, dealing with the elf.\"  Abigail's face went white, \"Fiona? Something happened to her?\"  The healer shrugged, \"I dunno.\"  She gritted her teeth and turned, limping as fast as she could.  Bateman spotted her near the entrance, \"So? Maidr there?\"  \"No.\" Abigail swallowed, \"Something happened to Fi. Down at the gate.\"  Bateman looked at the Vitamancer and winced, \"Don't let those feelings overwhelm you. You're still linked to the Circle.\"  Abigail nodded, fighting back tears, \"We have to get Maidr, and she's at the gate.\"  The professor walked beside her, supporting her, and he looked at her leg, noticing the black arrow sticking sideways out of her knee for the first time, \"When did that happen?\"  \"Eighth or ninth wave of vampires.\" Abigail shrugged, wincing at the movement, \"I didn't really have time to pay attention to that sort of thing.\"  Bateman bit the inside of his cheek and she looked at him, \"Wait\u2026 Something wrong?\"  \"Vampires use cursed arrows. If that doesn't get fixed soon\u2026 You're dead.\" The professor said hesitantly, fear in his voice, and Abigail ground her teeth together, \"If I ever see Kyle again, I'm killing him myself.\"    Fiona stared wide-eyed at the world.  It seemed both blurry, and so focused that it hurt, at the same time.  She couldn't think straight, only one thought spinning around and around in her head, something was wrong.  The idea that something was wrong filled her, it was the strongest conviction she held in her life, but she couldn't work out what exactly was wrong.  Every time she tried, she was overwhelmed by the thought again, leaving her motionless, as the world blurred and moved around her.  She felt beyond dizzy, as if she could never come back from it, breathing only happened whenever she could focus all her energy on it.  However, strange enough, she wasn't in any pain at all.  That was wrong.  Fiona sat bolt upright, and immediately she was stabbed with more pain than she had ever felt, every nerve in her body lighting up like a christmas tree, and she went to scream, but all that came out was a groan.    Andre pulled his hand out of the elf's chest, glaring at the vampire who was interrupting his torture, \"What is it?\"  The vampire winced, \"We've been attacked. The Troll Hoarde has been defeated.\"  Andre glared, \"Say what?\"  \"From their bloody insignia, it's New Rome.\" The vampire growled, and Andre's face fell, \"Damn it.\"  He swept the groaning and only half-alive King Applesilver onto his shoulder, \"Sound the retreat. I'm not fighting an army of Vampire Hunters today.\"  He ran across the ground, being careful of the whiplash, he didn't want the king to die before he could be useful. The man hadn't even had a chance to be any fun yet.  He leapt into the air, cruising above a cloud, before sharply turning and shooting out towards a distant mountain surrounded by a black thunderstorm.  He touched down onto the soil softly, and walked inside the cave, dumping King Applesilver in the infirmary, and looked around at the leaders of the other armies, \"New Rome has arrived. They decided to side with the elves.\"    Abigail spun a wave of magic at the wall of arrows falling over the gate towards the two professors and one prone form. They spun in the air, screeching and flew back towards the soldiers who had fired them.  The nymph glared over at the professors, \"What's the situation?\"  Maidr winced, \"Abigail\u2026 You shouldn't be here.\"  The Headmaster sighed and rubbed his face, \"She is now. I could use the backup. Holding that gate is getting\u2026 Problematic.\"  Abigail walked over, looking down at the shivering and shaking figure of her friend, and she swallowed nervously. Fiona was soaked in sweat, her teeth chattered, and her eyes were constantly roaming - independently of each other.  She looked at Maidr in concern, \"What the hell happened?\"  The pixie looked at her sadly, \"There's nothing we can do, Abigail.\"  She felt anger hit her, and she yellowed, her scales flashing to a bright red, \"What happened!?\"  The Headmaster put a hand on her shoulder, \"Vampire attack. Tore out her throat, and infected her with some nasty vampire poison.\"  He jerked his attention skyward, \"Et sacrificate de caelo, nunc denuo in tenebris!\"  The sky blew up in flames for a moment, and he looked at her carefully, \"I need your help here, Miss Inglis. We're losing this war.\"  Abigail glared at him, \"I need to help Fi.\"  \"You can't!\" He roared, his voice changing pitch, and Abigail felt a tremble of fear as the low of his voice echoed through her. It felt\u2026 Wrong.  She shook her head, spinning her wand, \"I can do more than you think\u2026 Professor Maidr, what's the matter?\"  The pixie sighed heavily, \"She can't heal anymore. I've stopped the bleeding, but I can't form any scar tissue. So\u2026 Breathing is an issue. I'm keeping her alive\u2026 But I stop doing anything\u2026 She dies.\"  Abigail winced, \"I can do just about any Vitamancy.\"  The pixie shook her head, \"That's not going to help. It needs to be Sanamancy.\"  Abigail shrugged, \"So\u2026 Link with me. Use my magic.\"  The pixie stared at her, \"Are you kidding? You need a circle of eight mages to form a circle. Always.\"  The nymph cocked her head, \"Kyle didn't.\"  The professor stared, \"Really? That's\u2026 Impossible.\"  The Headmaster laughed as he finished another defensive spell, \"No\u2026 Only highly improbable. Now are you done wasting your time, Abigail?\"  She spun, launching herself at him, knocking the professor to the ground, jamming her wand up against his Adam's apple, \"I am not wasting my time!\"  The Headmaster glared at her, \"I tried to save Fiona.\"  Abigail felt the anger flowing through her, the hatred, seeking a target, and she couldn't see a better one. She just wanted to see him die.    The general of the Balsa Army sat in a tree, eating an apple.   Below him, New Roman soldiers battle trolls, whilst vampires took the air and ran.  As for him and his army, they sat in the trees, waiting for the moment when the opportunity was best.  He wasn't an idiot.  Emmanuel Andrews remembered the school quite well, and if the flames in the distance were anything to judge by, his old professor still stood strong and defended the school.  But even Bateman had his own weaknesses.  All he had to do was wait, and then he could melt the skin off of anyone who opposed him.  He smiled.  Unlike the rest who were here, Balsa, as a nation, had decided that the death of Kyle Kilroy was not in their best interest.  They wanted to bring him back.    There were nine vampiric armies in the Shadowlands. Seven had come to destroy the abomination hidden behind a castle wall, defended by a thousand mages.  They shouldn't stand a chance, but so far, the School of History and Magic had been incredibly tenacious.  That being said, the fight they were putting up couldn't be said to be overwhelming. Their defeat was simply a matter of time.  Andre's face grew dark, knowing that the resurrection of Kyle Kilroy was also simply a matter of time.  The young man, an Aimimancer, was incredibly dangerous, and far too clever for his own good.  It had been one of his subordinates that had killed Kyle's family, sloppily leaving the child alive.  Andre had been forced to interfere, blank Kyle's mind and send him away, four times since the child had managed to save his own life with the dark magic that almost all vampires used as instinctively as an elf might control the elements... But meeting Kyle had changed Andre's mind on that one.  Kyle professed to be far from a master with Aimimancy, and yet he could cast spells with it better than a single person that Andre had ever seen.  He looked at the gathering of generals again and sighed, it fell to him to achieve the goals.  \"We have captured King Applesilver, a bargaining chip against the elves, perhaps. But today, they are not our enemy. Removing them will simply strengthen the defences of the school. To win this war, all these armies must be united. Trolls, elves, humans and vampires. A unites front against Kyle Kilroy. We have different motivations, and this alliance will disintegrate the moment that his body is destroyed... But it must be done.\"  The other vampires looked at him in shock and revulsion, but Andre shrugged.  He had only spoken the truth, and as the night fell outside, he knew that they had to speed this war to its end, or Kilroy would end them all.",

            "text": "Chapter Ten\n\n\n\n\nAntonio glanced up from his map as a dark man entered the tent, covered in strips of black cloth.\n\n\nThe General of the New Roman army grinned, \"Emmanual. So Balsa has finally made a decision, has it?\"\n\n\nThe general shrugged, \"We arrived before New Rome, Antonio.\"\n\n\nHe frowned, glancing at the man, \"Are you here as an attack?\"\n\n\nEmmanuel shook his head, spreading his hands, \"Though I was not seen, I did not attack any of your men. Nor do I wish to attack you.\"\n\n\nAntonio winced, \"But you will if?\"\n\n\n\"Balsa has decided that Kyle Kilroy should live.\"\n\n\nAntonio's hand flew to his hilt, and he winced as he felt his arm and numb and droop as Emmanuel flashed closer to him. The Balsa General shook his head, \"I thought we were friends, Antonio.\"\n\n\nHe glared, \"I have my orders, Emmanuel. You know I have to carry them out.\"\n\n\n\"I know,\" the man said gravely, \"But I would spare my friend the horrors of battle. You will be replaced by a doppelganger. Your army will return home. Once Kyle Kilroy has resurrected, you will be returned to your people.\"\n\n\nAntonio ground his teeth, but he knew there was little he could do.\n\n\nHe was outmatched by a man who could paralyse his throat before he could yell for help.\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"Do as you will.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red light of the sun crept up the molten and wrangled gates, illuminating a fallen figure in a pool of liquid, reflecting the sunlight.\n\n\nAll around the figure shadowy monsters stalked, victorious expressions of jubilation expressing itself through their body language.\n\n\nHigh up on the wall a small group of mages screamed in agony, pitiful bouts of magic still striking out, but the sheer number of figures surrounding them revealed the doom of their situation.\n\n\nFar behind them the great wooden doors to the school lay shattered and burned, and the shadows of trolls strode to and fro.\n\n\nWithin the cafeteria, where once had been served poisonous substances with a small aspect of edibility, now lay students, covered in blood and ripped limb from limb.\n\n\nHigh above, in the infirmary, lay yet more prone bodies, some slumped over those that had been injured, others turned into a slush upon the floor.\n\n\nExcept for one.\n\n\nA blue scaled girl, with brunette hair, opened her eyes slowly, gasping in pain.\n\n\nShe sat up, her scales fading as skin replaced it, and she held her head.\n\n\nShe couldn't remember what had happened.\n\n\nShe'd been defending the gates, trying to destroy the elves and vampires cascading at her, and then...\n\n\nAbigail cringed.\n\n\nHer wand had snapped, overpowered.\n\n\nA shockwave of Vitamancy had rolled out, and then nothing.\n\n\nShe'd just been... Here.\n\n\nAbigail glanced around, she immediately screamed and tossed herself back into a corner, covering her mouth.\n\n\nThey'd lost.\n\n\nShe'd let them through the gates, and now everyone was dead.\n\n\nA small flame appeared in the middle of the room, and then vanished, a piece of crumpled paper fell to the ground.\n\n\nAbigail stared, walking over and picking it up suspiciously, and her jaw dropped.\n\n\n\"Wasn't your fault, Abi. Oh, and they didn't get my body. A few traps. For now, you need to get out of here. I'm with Fiona. - Kyle.\"\n\n\nShe swallowed nervously, staring around.\n\n\nKyle could have stopped all this, instead he had saved Fiona.\n\n\nIt was... Ridiculous.\n\n\nReally?\n\n\nHe chose her?\n\n\nShe started to cry.\n\n\nAnother flame appeared, a small piece of paper falling, and she grabbed it frantically.\n\n\n\"I mean it. Get out now. I don't think I can save you from impossible odds twice. - Kyle.\"\n\n\nShe could have slapped herself.\n\n\nHe had saved her from her own wand, and brought her to the infirmary, when everyone else was fighting.\n\n\nShe stood up slowly, and crept over to a window, looking out.\n\n\nShe shivered at the sight, vampires perched across the walls, and the Elven Army was camped at the gate. Behind them were trolls walking around idly, and more armies. She recognized the phoenix of New Rome, but the other two were unknown to her.\n\n\nShe swallowed and ducked back. She had to get out, but she wouldn't be escaping via the hill.\n\n\nWhich only left the cliff.\n\n\nA thousand meter dive into magical-shark infested waters.\n\n\nIt was utterly insane.\n\n\nAbigail grinned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle knelt over Fiona, his hands humming with magic, as he held her head, tears in his eyes.\n\n\nHe heard a cough from behind him and he sneered, \"What do you want, Vampire?\"\n\n\n\"My name is Andre. I lead one of the Armies of the Shadowlands.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"And I care why?\"\n\n\n\"There was an alliance created against you.\" The vampire begun, his voice that of a politician, \"We would like to speak to you.\"\n\n\nKyle stood up slowly, turning, rage written on his face, \"If Fiona dies, I will destroy every single soldier from every single one of your petty armies.\"\n\n\nThe vampire frowned, \"She was attacked by a vampire, yes?\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"So you know what is wrong?\"\n\n\n\"She's dying.\" The vampire said carefully, \"But she won't remain that way. She'll be a vampire by tomorrow. Give her a couple hundred years to get control of the blood lust, and she will be good as new.\"\n\n\nKyle glared, \"That won't be happening.\"\n\n\nThe vampire winced, \"It's nature. We can't bend the rules, only bend what everyone thinks are the rules. Surely you know that.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"Aimimancy, yes. But I'm not an Aimimancer anymore. Which is why they sent you. To see if I could control you.\"\n\n\nThe vampire shrugged, \"Do you blame them?\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"No... Tell me, did you release King Applesilver? I got a little distracted, so I didn't see.\"\n\n\nThe vampire started, \"Yes... How did you know we captured him?\"\n\n\n\"You did.\" Kyle said, looking down at Fiona, \"Personally. Now... I want to talk to Applesilver.\"\n\n\nThe vampire sighed, \"So you won't come with me?\"\n\n\nKyle spun back, every surface of the room bursting into flames, \"I will deal with your pathetic council later!\"\n\n\nThe vampire screamed as he burned, and then the flames receded, partly. They opened a channel back to the door through which he had entered.\n\n\nKyle turned back to Fiona, reaching out into the abyss that was magic, and shaping it. He couldn't know exactly what he was supposed to do, he had no idea how to heal a vampire's attack. So instead, he gave the magic a purpose, and a small tendril of life.\n\n\nIt sought out inside her, finding the invaders, trying to fight on her behalf, bonding with her system.\n\n\nKyle smiled, it was similar to the protection spell that ended up with him stuck in limbo, a sentient immune system made of magic.\n\n\nConsidering he had been struck by one of the nastier enchantments he knew of, which had turned his entire nervous system to ice, whereas Fiona was being kept alive by the enchanted strike.\n\n\n\"What do you want, abomination?\" Came a growl from behind him, and Kyle turned slowly, inspecting the king. He was less haggard than he had expected, but the bandages around his arms and covering his chest revealed the damage the elf had been through.\n\n\nKyle gestured, \"Your daughter is turning into a vampire. I am going to heal her.\"\n\n\nThe king sneered, \"Why do you want me? She means nothing.\"\n\n\nKyle vanished, reappearing an inch from the king's face, anger burning in his eyes, \"Disrespect her again, and I'll take what I need and throw your corpse to the trolls.\"\n\n\nApplesilver swallowed nervously, \"What do you want?\"\n\n\nKyle sighed and flicked his hand, a knife appearing in it, \"I need your blood. Just a small amount.\"\n\n\nThe king laughed, \"No.\"\n\n\nThere was a flash, and the king lay on the ground, screaming, the knife sticking from his shoulder, and Kyle crouched over Fiona's prone body, a small bubble of blood floating over her.\n\n\nHe spoke quietly, feeling the familiar magic flowing through him.\n\n\n\"A sanguine peccatoris, et ab anima patris sui.\n\n\nFrom blood before, and ancestor soul.\n\n\nSolve vincula, quasi in corde irritum facit animam,\n\n\nBreak the bonds, tear the heart, unmake the soul,\n\n\nTolle tenebris liberare lamia destruunt quod malum facere.\n\n\nTake now the darkness, free the vampire, destroy that which is evil.\n\n\nRedige libera ad mortem, et a me praeceptum.\n\n\nBring back, free her from endless death at my command.\"\n\n\nThe blood evaporated, and Kyle breathed a sigh of relief, collapsing backwards, sweat cascading off him.\n\n\nHe felt a bloody knife tip touch the edge of his neck, \"What do you think you're doing, Necromancer? You think you can just stab a king and get away with it.\"\n\n\nKyle clenched his fists, and the king yelled in surprise.\n\n\nThe young Necromancer turned, glaring up at the man he was suspending in the air, and he sneered, \"Whilst you're hanging there, let me make myself clear. If I had not had to attend to Fiona, then you would be dead. I don't care that you are her father, and you don't seem to either. If I hadn't had to heal her, then not a single elf, vampire, troll or human who attacked this castle would be alive.\"\n\n\nHe gestured to Fiona behind him, \"There is no cure for vampirism. Never has been.\"\n\n\nThe elf gasped, sitting up suddenly, holding her neck, and Kyle smiled, \"Till now.\"\n\n\nHe turned and walked over, grabbing her hands gently, \"Hey, Fi.\"\n\n\nShe glared, \"I never said you could call me that.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"I'm sorry. Been\u2026 A while since I've been able to talk to someone without them wanting to murder me in my sleep.\"\n\n\nFiona smiled and reached out, hugging him, tears welling in her eyes, \"You came. That's what matters\u2026\"\n\n\nAs her voice trailed off, Kyle laughed, and turned, \"I needed some blood from your dad to be able to heal you. I didn't really hurt him, just the shoulder. Before everyone ganged up on us, vampires kidnapped him.\"\n\n\nFiona burst out laughing, \"Really? Father? You let a vampire kidnap you?\"\n\n\nThe king glared down, \"You are still a Black Knight, Fiona. You owe your loyalty to me.\"\n\n\nShe clenched her fists, standing slowly, \"Truly? Then why did Kyle have to forcibly take your blood? You know that before his death he was basically the greatest Aimimancer in the world.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed and stood, touching her shoulder gently, \"I'm sorry, but I need to go talk to the rest of the idiots here. Something about me being scary now.\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, \"Need some help?\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"I told Abigail to run. I expect you to do so, now. Try and meet up with her\u2026 So far as things stand, the school has been obliterated. Draco is dead. So are most of the professors. I think maybe a dozen students survived. There's nothing here for us.\"\n\n\nShe smiled, and gave him a quick hug, \"Stay safe.\"\n\n\nKyle rolled his eyes, \"What are they going to do? Kill me?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona glared at her father as Kyle left the room.\n\n\nThe king dropped to the ground, standing slowly, and the two elves stared at each other.\n\n\nHer father spoke first, \"You are a Black Knight. You swore an oath to protect me. You bound it with a spell that will kill you, if you fail in your duty.\"\n\n\nFiona smiled softly, \"Firstly, that oath? It says I must protect my nation. If I believe you aren't in the best interests of the nation\u2026 I can kill you. Secondly\u2026 I just died. There are no spells binding me. They're gone.\"\n\n\nKing Applesilver's ears leaned backwards, and he bared his teeth, \"Are you threatening me, daughter? I raised you. I trained you.\"\n\n\nFiona clenched her fists, \"You trained me? No\u2026 I was trained by a golem. I was trained by a Pyromancer. I was trained by an Aimimancer and a Necromancer.\"\n\n\nHer father spread his hands, whispering, and Fiona laughed, \"You're an Aquamancer dad.\"\n\n\nShe glared, \"Contere arrogant spurius lapis, occidamus eum pro me.\"\n\n\nThe floor folded up, forming two large slabs of stone either side of the king and slammed shut with a gruesome splash of blood and bone.\n\n\nFiona shook her head, \"There's no water here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle walked into the room slowly, trying to ignore what he had heard down the hall, it was Fiona's choice.\n\n\nThough he hadn't expected her to do some nearly as drastic as that.\n\n\nThe people in the room were hardly as distracted, and he could count bared fangs, claws, and angry glares just by glancing around.\n\n\nKyle flicked his wrist and a stone table with chairs sprang up out of the floor. He smiled and sat down, \"So, you wanted to see me?\"\n\n\nAndre, the vampire leader present, stared at him in astonishment, \"You being here\u2026 Means\u2026 You cured the elf? From a vampire attack?\"\n\n\nKyle looked over at him, \"No. Of course not. I'm here to kill you, because she died.\"\n\n\nThe room went quiet and Kyle rolled his eyes, \"If I actually was going to kill him, he would already be dead.\"\n\n\nHe glared, looking around, \"All of you came here for one reason, or another. You came either to make sure my body was destroyed, or preserved. I survived. And\u2026 I'm not entirely pleased to see the destruction. Many of my professors, who earned my respect, are dead. You even managed to kill the only dragon-human hybrid. Not really happy with any of you.\"\n\n\nOne of the men walked over and sat down, \"I am General Antonio Guerra, for the New Roman Empire. What would it take for you to rejoin the dead?\"\n\n\nKyle blinked, \"You\u2026 Are stupid. I can't. I am neither living nor dead.\"\n\n\nThe general frowned, \"You have no part in this world. We can't kill you anymore, but we will contain you, if that is necessary.\"\n\n\nKyle rolled his eyes and gestured with his finger, and the general's head smashed into the table at speed. The stone shattered, as did the skull.\n\n\nThe young necromancer looked around the room, \"I'm just demonstrating a point. None of you, even if you gang up on me, have a shadow of a chance.\"\n\n\nHe clicked his fingers, and the general jerked up again, looking around wildly, and Kyle smiled, \"Enjoy your time on the Other Side? Meet a few people I know?\"\n\n\nAntonio swallowed, \"You\u2026 You\u2026 You killed me.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"No duh.\"\n\n\n\"And brought me back.\" The general growled, glaring at him, \"You turned me into a monster!\"\n\n\n\"I am the only monster here!\" Kyle yelled angrily, standing up, the table and chairs melting back into the floor, \"None of you can do a thing to me. You don't seem to understand that. So I think I need to make a point.\"\n\n\nHe turned, glaring, \"Troll.\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac looked down at Kyle, his face full of boredom, and Kyle smiled softly, \"Trolls are quite strong, yes?\"\n\n\nThe leader nodded softly, and Kyle grinned, \"Do trolls have weaknesses?\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac sighed, \"Hunger and\u2026 Not smart.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"Yeah\u2026 Do you know that I like you, Isaac Isaac? You take advantage and think about your people with\u2026 Well, for a troll, it would be genius.\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac frowned, \"Why compliment\u2026 Me?\"\n\n\nKyle sighed, \"Because I am going to hurt trolls. Badly.\"\n\n\nThe troll's fists snapped shut, \"Necromancer not hurt trolls.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"I need to make a point. And trolls\u2026 They aren't important to these others. So\u2026 Trolls need some more anger at them.\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac glared, \"What do\u2026 You mean?\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"Because the others don't think you and all trolls are important, I choose to curse you and your people.\"\n\n\nThe necromancer smiled softly, \"Cum sol Troglodytarum non movebitur. Et lapis sint.\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac yelled angrily, raising his fist, but he froze on the spot, the light fading from his eyes.\n\n\nKyle turned around, \"Look outside, gentlemen. Trolls, as a species, can no longer bear sunlight.\"\n\n\nHe spread his hands, \"Now\u2026 I don't want to have to conquer this world. But I probably could.\"",

He was outmatched by a man who could paralyse his throat before he could yell for help.  He shrugged, \"Do as you will.\"    The red light of the sun crept up the molten and wrangled gates, illuminating a fallen figure in a pool of liquid, reflecting the sunlight.  All around the figure shadowy monsters stalked, victorious expressions of jubilation expressing itself through their body language.  High up on the wall a small group of mages screamed in agony, pitiful bouts of magic still striking out, but the sheer number of figures surrounding them revealed the doom of their situation.  Far behind them the great wooden doors to the school lay shattered and burned, and the shadows of trolls strode to and fro.  Within the cafeteria, where once had been served poisonous substances with a small aspect of edibility, now lay students, covered in blood and ripped limb from limb.  High above, in the infirmary, lay yet more prone bodies, some slumped over those that had been injured, others turned into a slush upon the floor.  Except for one.  A blue scaled girl, with brunette hair, opened her eyes slowly, gasping in pain.  She sat up, her scales fading as skin replaced it, and she held her head.  She couldn't remember what had happened.  She'd been defending the gates, trying to destroy the elves and vampires cascading at her, and then...  Abigail cringed.  Her wand had snapped, overpowered.  A shockwave of Vitamancy had rolled out, and then nothing.  She'd just been... Here.  Abigail glanced around, she immediately screamed and tossed herself back into a corner, covering her mouth.  They'd lost.  She'd let them through the gates, and now everyone was dead.  A small flame appeared in the middle of the room, and then vanished, a piece of crumpled paper fell to the ground.

He had saved her from her own wand, and brought her to the infirmary, when everyone else was fighting.  She stood up slowly, and crept over to a window, looking out.  She shivered at the sight, vampires perched across the walls, and the Elven Army was camped at the gate. Behind them were trolls walking around idly, and more armies. She recognized the phoenix of New Rome, but the other two were unknown to her.  She swallowed and ducked back. She had to get out, but she wouldn't be escaping via the hill.  Which only left the cliff.  A thousand meter dive into magical-shark infested waters.  It was utterly insane.  Abigail grinned.    Kyle knelt over Fiona, his hands humming with magic, as he held her head, tears in his eyes.  He heard a cough from behind him and he sneered, \"What do you want, Vampire?\"  \"My name is Andre. I lead one of the Armies of the Shadowlands.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"And I care why?\"  \"There was an alliance created against you.\" The vampire begun, his voice that of a politician, \"We would like to speak to you.\"  Kyle stood up slowly, turning, rage written on his face, \"If Fiona dies, I will destroy every single soldier from every single one of your petty armies.\"  The vampire frowned, \"She was attacked by a vampire, yes?\"  Kyle nodded, \"So you know what is wrong?\"  \"She's dying.\" The vampire said carefully, \"But she won't remain that way. She'll be a vampire by tomorrow. Give her a couple hundred years to get control of the blood lust, and she will be good as new.\"  Kyle glared, \"That won't be happening.\"  The vampire winced, \"It's nature. We can't bend the rules, only bend what everyone thinks are the rules. Surely you know that.\"  Kyle nodded, \"Aimimancy, yes. But I'm not an Aimimancer anymore. Which is why they sent you. To see if I could control you.\"  The vampire shrugged, \"Do you blame them?\"  Kyle shook his head, \"No... Tell me, did you release King Applesilver? I got a little distracted, so I didn't see.\"  The vampire started, \"Yes... How did you know we captured him?\"  \"You did.\" Kyle said, looking down at Fiona, \"Personally. Now... I want to talk to Applesilver.\"  The vampire sighed, \"So you won't come with me?\"  Kyle spun back, every surface of the room bursting into flames, \"I will deal with your pathetic council later!\"  The vampire screamed as he burned, and then the flames receded, partly. They opened a channel back to the door through which he had entered.  Kyle turned back to Fiona, reaching out into the abyss that was magic, and shaping it. He couldn't know exactly what he was supposed to do, he had no idea how to heal a vampire's attack. So instead, he gave the magic a purpose, and a small tendril of life.  It sought out inside her, finding the invaders, trying to fight on her behalf, bonding with her system.  Kyle smiled, it was similar to the protection spell that ended up with him stuck in limbo, a sentient immune system made of magic.  Considering he had been struck by one of the nastier enchantments he knew of, which had turned his entire nervous system to ice, whereas Fiona was being kept alive by the enchanted strike.  \"What do you want, abomination?\" Came a growl from behind him, and Kyle turned slowly, inspecting the king. He was less haggard than he had expected, but the bandages around his arms and covering his chest revealed the damage the elf had been through.  Kyle gestured, \"Your daughter is turning into a vampire. I am going to heal her.\"  The king sneered, \"Why do you want me? She means nothing.\"  Kyle vanished, reappearing an inch from the king's face, anger burning in his eyes, \"Disrespect her again, and I'll take what I need and throw your corpse to the trolls.\"  Applesilver swallowed nervously, \"What do you want?\"  Kyle sighed and flicked his hand, a knife appearing in it, \"I need your blood. Just a small amount.\"  The king laughed, \"No.\"  There was a flash, and the king lay on the ground, screaming, the knife sticking from his shoulder, and Kyle crouched over Fiona's prone body, a small bubble of blood floating over her.  He spoke quietly, feeling the familiar magic flowing through him.  \"A sanguine peccatoris, et ab anima patris sui.  From blood before, and ancestor soul.  Solve vincula, quasi in corde irritum facit animam,  Break the bonds, tear the heart, unmake the soul,  Tolle tenebris liberare lamia destruunt quod malum facere.  Take now the darkness, free the vampire, destroy that which is evil.  Redige libera ad mortem, et a me praeceptum.  Bring back, free her from endless death at my command.\"  The blood evaporated, and Kyle breathed a sigh of relief, collapsing backwards, sweat cascading off him.  He felt a bloody knife tip touch the edge of his neck, \"What do you think you're doing, Necromancer? You think you can just stab a king and get away with it.\"  Kyle clenched his fists, and the king yelled in surprise.  The young Necromancer turned, glaring up at the man he was suspending in the air, and he sneered, \"Whilst you're hanging there, let me make myself clear. If I had not had to attend to Fiona, then you would be dead. I don't care that you are her father, and you don't seem to either. If I hadn't had to heal her, then not a single elf, vampire, troll or human who attacked this castle would be alive.\"  He gestured to Fiona behind him, \"There is no cure for vampirism. Never has been.\"  The elf gasped, sitting up suddenly, holding her neck, and Kyle smiled, \"Till now.\"  He turned and walked over, grabbing her hands gently, \"Hey, Fi.\"  She glared, \"I never said you could call me that.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"I'm sorry. Been\u2026 A while since I've been able to talk to someone without them wanting to murder me in my sleep.\"  Fiona smiled and reached out, hugging him, tears welling in her eyes, \"You came. That's what matters\u2026\"  As her voice trailed off, Kyle laughed, and turned, \"I needed some blood from your dad to be able to heal you. I didn't really hurt him, just the shoulder. Before everyone ganged up on us, vampires kidnapped him.\"  Fiona burst out laughing, \"Really? Father? You let a vampire kidnap you?\"  The king glared down, \"You are still a Black Knight, Fiona. You owe your loyalty to me.\"  She clenched her fists, standing slowly, \"Truly? Then why did Kyle have to forcibly take your blood? You know that before his death he was basically the greatest Aimimancer in the world.\"  Kyle sighed and stood, touching her shoulder gently, \"I'm sorry, but I need to go talk to the rest of the idiots here. Something about me being scary now.\"  Fiona frowned, \"Need some help?\"  Kyle shook his head, \"I told Abigail to run. I expect you to do so, now. Try and meet up with her\u2026 So far as things stand, the school has been obliterated. Draco is dead. So are most of the professors. I think maybe a dozen students survived. There's nothing here for us.\"  She smiled, and gave him a quick hug, \"Stay safe.\"  Kyle rolled his eyes, \"What are they going to do? Kill me?\"    Fiona glared at her father as Kyle left the room.  The king dropped to the ground, standing slowly, and the two elves stared at each other.  Her father spoke first, \"You are a Black Knight. You swore an oath to protect me. You bound it with a spell that will kill you, if you fail in your duty.\"  Fiona smiled softly, \"Firstly, that oath? It says I must protect my nation. If I believe you aren't in the best interests of the nation\u2026 I can kill you. Secondly\u2026 I just died. There are no spells binding me. They're gone.\"  King Applesilver's ears leaned backwards, and he bared his teeth, \"Are you threatening me, daughter? I raised you. I trained you.\"  Fiona clenched her fists, \"You trained me? No\u2026 I was trained by a golem. I was trained by a Pyromancer. I was trained by an Aimimancer and a Necromancer.\"  Her father spread his hands, whispering, and Fiona laughed, \"You're an Aquamancer dad.\"  She glared, \"Contere arrogant spurius lapis, occidamus eum pro me.\"  The floor folded up, forming two large slabs of stone either side of the king and slammed shut with a gruesome splash of blood and bone.  Fiona shook her head, \"There's no water here.\"    Kyle walked into the room slowly, trying to ignore what he had heard down the hall, it was Fiona's choice.  Though he hadn't expected her to do some nearly as drastic as that.  The people in the room were hardly as distracted, and he could count bared fangs, claws, and angry glares just by glancing around.  Kyle flicked his wrist and a stone table with chairs sprang up out of the floor. He smiled and sat down, \"So, you wanted to see me?\"  Andre, the vampire leader present, stared at him in astonishment, \"You being here\u2026 Means\u2026 You cured the elf? From a vampire attack?\"  Kyle looked over at him, \"No. Of course not. I'm here to kill you, because she died.\"  The room went quiet and Kyle rolled his eyes, \"If I actually was going to kill him, he would already be dead.\"  He glared, looking around, \"All of you came here for one reason, or another. You came either to make sure my body was destroyed, or preserved. I survived. And\u2026 I'm not entirely pleased to see the destruction. Many of my professors, who earned my respect, are dead. You even managed to kill the only dragon-human hybrid. Not really happy with any of you.\"  One of the men walked over and sat down, \"I am General Antonio Guerra, for the New Roman Empire. What would it take for you to rejoin the dead?\"  Kyle blinked, \"You\u2026 Are stupid. I can't. I am neither living nor dead.\"  The general frowned, \"You have no part in this world. We can't kill you anymore, but we will contain you, if that is necessary.\"  Kyle rolled his eyes and gestured with his finger, and the general's head smashed into the table at speed. The stone shattered, as did the skull.  The young necromancer looked around the room, \"I'm just demonstrating a point. None of you, even if you gang up on me, have a shadow of a chance.\"  He clicked his fingers, and the general jerked up again, looking around wildly, and Kyle smiled, \"Enjoy your time on the Other Side? Meet a few people I know?\"  Antonio swallowed, \"You\u2026 You\u2026 You killed me.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"No duh.\"  \"And brought me back.\" The general growled, glaring at him, \"You turned me into a monster!\"  \"I am the only monster here!\" Kyle yelled angrily, standing up, the table and chairs melting back into the floor, \"None of you can do a thing to me. You don't seem to understand that. So I think I need to make a point.\"  He turned, glaring, \"Troll.\"  Isaac Isaac looked down at Kyle, his face full of boredom, and Kyle smiled softly, \"Trolls are quite strong, yes?\"  The leader nodded softly, and Kyle grinned, \"Do trolls have weaknesses?\"  Isaac Isaac sighed, \"Hunger and\u2026 Not smart.\"  Kyle nodded, \"Yeah\u2026 Do you know that I like you, Isaac Isaac? You take advantage and think about your people with\u2026 Well, for a troll, it would be genius.\"  Isaac Isaac frowned, \"Why compliment\u2026 Me?\"  Kyle sighed, \"Because I am going to hurt trolls. Badly.\"  The troll's fists snapped shut, \"Necromancer not hurt trolls.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"I need to make a point. And trolls\u2026 They aren't important to these others. So\u2026 Trolls need some more anger at them.\"  Isaac Isaac glared, \"What do\u2026 You mean?\"  Kyle smiled, \"Because the others don't think you and all trolls are important, I choose to curse you and your people.\"  The necromancer smiled softly, \"Cum sol Troglodytarum non movebitur. Et lapis sint.\"  Isaac Isaac yelled angrily, raising his fist, but he froze on the spot, the light fading from his eyes.  Kyle turned around, \"Look outside, gentlemen. Trolls, as a species, can no longer bear sunlight.\"  He spread his hands, \"Now\u2026 I don't want to have to conquer this world. But I probably could.\"",

I am glad to see you have survived this chaos.\"\n\n\nShe nodded towards the troll, \"You do this?\"\n\n\n\"Kyle.\" Duke said darkly and shook his head, \"He's cursed the species. They turn to stone and lose their life when exposed to the sun\u2026 I could undo it\u2026 It's an evil act\u2026 But he surely has a reason.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"Kyle became a Necromancer really quickly, didn't he?\"\n\n\nDuke nodded, \"Yes and no. One of the first things I learned, after I died, was that time truly is relative, like the laws of physics tell us. And magic can manipulate that. Kyle used that to return, attempting to avert the disaster that has just happened.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled, \"And you? What did you try and do?\"\n\n\nThe dryad looked down sadly, \"I attempted to change the past. I found I could not. Once something has been observed, the outcome is determined. I could not change that observation.\"\n\n\nThe nymph smiled softly, \"So what now, professor?\"\n\n\nDuke looked up, staring at the school, \"Somehow, I must counsel Kyle. Teach him.\"\n\n\nAbigail blinked, \"Wait\u2026 Isn't he\u2026 Stronger than you?\"\n\n\n\"No.\" Duke said, shaking his head, \"Just less restrained. He has yet to understand how dangerous his discovery is to those he cares about.\"\n\n\nShe sighed heavily, \"Yay. Things are going to get worse, aren't they?\"\n\n\nThe dryad creaked as he shrugged, \"Perhaps. But for now, let us get you to safety.\"\n\n\nAbigail nodded, \"Yep. Sounds awesome\u2026 Where the hell would be safe?\"\n\n\nThe professor shrugged as they began to walk, \"To be honest\u2026 Nowhere is safe until Kyle has learned a semblance of restraint.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona stepped into the sunlight cautiously, as the door creaked shut behind her.\n\n\nShe was trying to calm her beating heart, but she was terrified.\n\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\n\nKyle had saved her, he'd been sure he had saved her... But... She wasn't.\n\n\nEvery time she had passed a body in the hallways, every time she'd seen a splash of blood, an overpowering desire to destroy and kill had seemed to swamp over her.\n\n\nStanding in the sun, at least there was some hope.\n\n\nVampires couldn't stand the sun.\n\n\nShe could.\n\n\nFiona brushed aside her blonde fringe, and looked around at the courtyard, her throat catching.\n\n\nIn the heart of the battle... It had been kill or be killed.\n\n\nBut now?\n\n\nShe knew these faces.\n\n\nMany had teased her, most had ignored her.\n\n\nFiona steeled herself.\n\n\nShe knew what it was to be a soldier.\n\n\nShe had killed and laid waste to armies before.\n\n\nBut it still hurt.\n\n\nThe elf walked out across the courtyard, magic at the ready, stepping carefully around the corpses.\n\n\nAs she neared the ruins which were the gates, she paused.\n\n\nA dozen stone soldiers stood at the ready, guarding a fallen mage.\n\n\nShe smiled weakly at them, \"The Headmaster?\"\n\n\nOne of the soldiers stepped forward, and then fell on one knee, slamming his stone spear butt-first into the ground with enough force to send plumes of dust into the air.\n\n\nHis voice was quiet, but still rattled the ground with an earth tremor, \"Bellum Draco lies dead. Our duty is bound to his successor.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, \"... And that would be?\"\n\n\n\"The Elven princess he died defending.\" The soldier said, staring at the ground, \"Headmistress Fiona Applesilver.\"\n\n\nShe blinked, confused.\n\n\n\"I'm still a student.\" She winced, looking around, \"Was... The school is... Dead.\"\n\n\nThe soldier nodded, \"And it shall be rebuilt. As it has before. It is only the heart of a pure being, one who has reached beyond the veil of death in service to this school who can lead it.\"\n\n\nFiona winced, \"I... I was running away. Trying to get somewhere safe.\"\n\n\nThe soldier stood, \"We are your vanguard. We will stand beside you, wherever you go. It is our duty to protect you, however long you live.\"\n\n\nFiona winced. There went the subtlety of her escape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am Emmanuel Andrews, leader of the Balsa Army.\" One of the generals said at length, as the others continued to stare at the stone that was Isaac Isaac, \"My queen bid that I take my army, to protect you. It seems, you have no need of protection, anymore.\"\n\n\nKyle glared at him, \"What do you want? I just cursed a species to make a point, and none of you seem to give a damn.\"\n\n\nEmmanuel nodded slowly, \"I understand the graveness of the situation, I assure you. I was sent to protect you, so that you might consider protecting Balsa, in the future.\"\n\n\nKyle raised an eyebrow, \"One good turn deserves another, does it?\"\n\n\nHe could feel the glare from Antonio digging into his back at the comment, and Emmanuel shrugged, \"It is clear that no one could control you, Kyle Kilroy. None on this planet. And who would be dumb enough to dare? However\u2026 Balsa is not a nation without enemies. Supporting you has put us in a critical position. If nothing else\u2026 We wish to be a safe haven for your allies. You can't protect them all.\"\n\n\nKyle burst out laughing, \"Really? I can't protect them all? Did you know that one of the few people I have ever dared to call a friend, an elf, was poisoned by a vampire recently? Do you know what happened to her?\"\n\n\nAndre glared, \"Yes\u2026 How exactly can one cure a vampire?\"\n\n\nKyle looked over at him carefully, \"I never said I cured her. I couldn't. The essence of a vampire\u2026 Is tenacious. Insidious.\"\n\n\nThe vampiric leader laughed harshly, \"You left a new vampire alone? In a castle full of the dead? It seems like I might replenish my ranks!\"\n\n\nKyle blinked, \"Take a look outside, Andre. Into the sun. Do you see any of your vampires there? Or have they hid in the shadows?\"\n\n\nAndre bared his fangs, \"Don't tease me, boy.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Fine. Don't see Fiona, out there. In broad daylight. Whilst you and your kind cling to the shade.\"\n\n\nThe vampire spun in shock, his face blistering as he looked out the window\u2026 But Kyle had spoken the truth. Andre pulled back, his face healing instantly, and he glared at Kyle, \"You can\u2026 Remove the sun as a danger? How?\"\n\n\nKyle sighed heavily, \"My parents were killed when I was younger\u2026 I was eleven years old. That's when I discovered magic. When I discovered the inherent power of Aimimancy. The reason I wanted to be a necromancer.\"\n\n\nHe paused, his face showing the pain of his years, and Kyle shook his head, \"For me, it's been hundreds of years since then. I have spent entire lifetimes in pursuit of answers\u2026 And the answer is you can't undo the past\u2026 You are left with this gaping wound in your soul, this absence of justice.\"\n\n\nThe young necromancer glared at Andre, \"I have the power to seek justice against the vampires who destroyed my home, killed my parents and lit it alight. I know who they are, where they are, and how to make them suffer without end.\"\n\n\nEmmanuel swallowed nervously, \"You plan to go to war with the vampires?\"\n\n\n\"I will obliterate the Shadowlands.\" Kyle growled, glaring, and the vampire leader spread his claws, \"If you utter a single syllable more\u2026\"\n\n\nKyle clenched a fist, and Andre collapsed to the ground, screeching high pitch enough that everyone else present grabbed their ears in pain, but Kyle seemed unaffected.\n\n\nHe knelt, glaring at the vampiric leader, \"The only reason I allow you to live, any of you, is that a close friend of mine was sired by one of your kind. Kill the sire, you kill the spawn. I don't want to have to bring her back from death again. The Other Side\u2026 Doesn't really like it when you interfere.\"\n\n\nKyle stood up, releasing his fist, and the vampire sprawled out on the ground, breathing hard, and it looked up at him, \"What\u2026 What will it take\u2026 To earn your\u2026 Mercy?\"\n\n\nThe necromancer blinked, \"Mercy? You want me to spare your people?\"\n\n\nAndre winced, \"I have no more quarrel with you. You are stronger, and I will bow to your will\u2026 But I wish for my people to live.\"\n\n\nKyle paused, blinking, \"That is\u2026 The first time I have ever heard a vampire submit. Amazing.\"\n\n\nHe turned away, \"If one of you doesn't kill him, I'll kill you all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail smiled softly as she crested the hill beside the dryad, her eyes sparkling, \"Awesome.\"\n\n\nDuke turned to her, \"What?\"\n\n\nAbigail pointed, \"The lake. That's where we're headed, right?\"\n\n\nA bright and brilliant blue lake stretched between mountain ranges on each horizon, shimmering in the heat of the morning sun, and the sight was sending tingles down the water nymph's back.\n\n\nDuke laughed, \"We are, but I hadn't thought to stop and swim. We have several armies wanting our heads, and they're only half a day's march behind. If Kyle manages to piss them off\u2026\"\n\n\nAbigail pouted, \"Damn.\"\n\n\nThe two began to carefully pick their path down the mountainside, climbing down towards the water, and Abigail thought as she walked.\n\n\nThis place was serene, peaceful.\n\n\nIt was her idea of heaven, and yet, twelve hours ago, she had been fighting for her life beside men and women who had spent her entire life in the pursuit of magic that she still could never dream of attaining.\n\n\nShe'd been able to cheat for a short while, with a wand that Kyle had enhanced for her.\n\n\nBut now, it was just her.\n\n\nAbigail winced, forcing away thoughts of trying to fight again.\n\n\nShe couldn't.\n\n\nIt had been\u2026 Too much.\n\n\n\"Vitamancers are the most sensitive of us.\" Duke spoke from up ahead, the dryad barely pausing for breath as he walked, \"You feel life. To have to destroy it\u2026 It's the worst thing that you could do to yourself.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"Can you feel my emotions, necromancer?\"\n\n\nThe dryad paused, sighing heavily, \"I truly wish I could not, young water nymph. You remind me of myself, when I was\u2026 Younger. Before I died.\"\n\n\nAbigail stopped, looking at him carefully, \"Kyle said something like there is no separation between the Schools of Magic\u2026 Is that\u2026 Right? Is necromancy just being able to use all magic?\"\n\n\nThe dryad shook his head, \"Not quite. All magic can use all other magic. So a necromancer\u2026 They have an advantage, in that we don't wield magic from a school. We can't. The normal ways to use magic are bared to us, because we have died. We're cut off\u2026 And so we learn to grasp raw magic. It's more powerful\u2026 And far more dangerous. It taints our soul. Binds it further and further to death, and the emotions that it can evoke.\"\n\n\nAbigail felt a chill of fear run down her back, \"But\u2026 Kyle has been\u2026 Using a crapload.\"\n\n\nDuke turned to her, \"For your sake, young water nymph, I wish Kyle to find himself again. Find a balance\u2026 Otherwise\u2026 There will be no worse fate than you loving him.\"\n\n\nAbigail blushed as she looked down, and she swallowed, \"Kyle was violent and vengeful before he died.\"\n\n\nDuke moved off again, \"I know.\"",

Whilst you and your kind cling to the shade.\"  The vampire spun in shock, his face blistering as he looked out the window\u2026 But Kyle had spoken the truth. Andre pulled back, his face healing instantly, and he glared at Kyle, \"You can\u2026 Remove the sun as a danger? How?\"  Kyle sighed heavily, \"My parents were killed when I was younger\u2026 I was eleven years old. That's when I discovered magic. When I discovered the inherent power of Aimimancy. The reason I wanted to be a necromancer.\"  He paused, his face showing the pain of his years, and Kyle shook his head, \"For me, it's been hundreds of years since then. I have spent entire lifetimes in pursuit of answers\u2026 And the answer is you can't undo the past\u2026 You are left with this gaping wound in your soul, this absence of justice.\"  The young necromancer glared at Andre, \"I have the power to seek justice against the vampires who destroyed my home, killed my parents and lit it alight. I know who they are, where they are, and how to make them suffer without end.\"  Emmanuel swallowed nervously, \"You plan to go to war with the vampires?\"  \"I will obliterate the Shadowlands.\" Kyle growled, glaring, and the vampire leader spread his claws, \"If you utter a single syllable more\u2026\"  Kyle clenched a fist, and Andre collapsed to the ground, screeching high pitch enough that everyone else present grabbed their ears in pain, but Kyle seemed unaffected.  He knelt, glaring at the vampiric leader, \"The only reason I allow you to live, any of you, is that a close friend of mine was sired by one of your kind. Kill the sire, you kill the spawn. I don't want to have to bring her back from death again. The Other Side\u2026 Doesn't really like it when you interfere.\"  Kyle stood up, releasing his fist, and the vampire sprawled out on the ground, breathing hard, and it looked up at him, \"What\u2026 What will it take\u2026 To earn your\u2026 Mercy?\"  The necromancer blinked, \"Mercy? You want me to spare your people?\"  Andre winced, \"I have no more quarrel with you. You are stronger, and I will bow to your will\u2026 But I wish for my people to live.\"  Kyle paused, blinking, \"That is\u2026 The first time I have ever heard a vampire submit. Amazing.\"  He turned away, \"If one of you doesn't kill him, I'll kill you all.\"    Abigail smiled softly as she crested the hill beside the dryad, her eyes sparkling, \"Awesome.\"  Duke turned to her, \"What?\"  Abigail pointed, \"The lake. That's where we're headed, right?\"  A bright and brilliant blue lake stretched between mountain ranges on each horizon, shimmering in the heat of the morning sun, and the sight was sending tingles down the water nymph's back.  Duke laughed, \"We are, but I hadn't thought to stop and swim. We have several armies wanting our heads, and they're only half a day's march behind. If Kyle manages to piss them off\u2026\"  Abigail pouted, \"Damn.\"  The two began to carefully pick their path down the mountainside, climbing down towards the water, and Abigail thought as she walked.  This place was serene, peaceful.  It was her idea of heaven, and yet, twelve hours ago, she had been fighting for her life beside men and women who had spent her entire life in the pursuit of magic that she still could never dream of attaining.  She'd been able to cheat for a short while, with a wand that Kyle had enhanced for her.  But now, it was just her.  Abigail winced, forcing away thoughts of trying to fight again.  She couldn't.  It had been\u2026 Too much.  \"Vitamancers are the most sensitive of us.\" Duke spoke from up ahead, the dryad barely pausing for breath as he walked, \"You feel life. To have to destroy it\u2026 It's the worst thing that you could do to yourself.\"  Abigail winced, \"Can you feel my emotions, necromancer?\"  The dryad paused, sighing heavily, \"I truly wish I could not, young water nymph. You remind me of myself, when I was\u2026 Younger. Before I died.\"  Abigail stopped, looking at him carefully, \"Kyle said something like there is no separation between the Schools of Magic\u2026 Is that\u2026 Right? Is necromancy just being able to use all magic?\"  The dryad shook his head, \"Not quite. All magic can use all other magic. So a necromancer\u2026 They have an advantage, in that we don't wield magic from a school. We can't. The normal ways to use magic are bared to us, because we have died. We're cut off\u2026 And so we learn to grasp raw magic. It's more powerful\u2026 And far more dangerous. It taints our soul. Binds it further and further to death, and the emotions that it can evoke.\"  Abigail felt a chill of fear run down her back, \"But\u2026 Kyle has been\u2026 Using a crapload.\"  Duke turned to her, \"For your sake, young water nymph, I wish Kyle to find himself again. Find a balance\u2026 Otherwise\u2026 There will be no worse fate than you loving him.\"  Abigail blushed as she looked down, and she swallowed, \"Kyle was violent and vengeful before he died.\"  Duke moved off again, \"I know.\"",

But here? In the water? I will always be free.\"\n\n\nShe stretched out her hands, the water rippling around her, and Abigail shrugged, \"This is home.\"\n\n\nBefore Duke could react she ducked under the water, spinning at high volume as her legs vanished, reforming into a single tail, propelling her beneath the lake in ways most people could only dream of.\n\n\nThe nymph spun as she swam, her eyes taking in everything, the insects that most humans never even realised existed, the algae and moss, all the thousands of colonies, fragile pieces of life.\n\n\nShe could hear the myriad of voices in the water, the ones that no one else ever seemed to hear. The chemical components that communicated between symbiotic lifeforces. The frequencies that no human could ever comprehend that echoed between brothers and sisters. The power of life in the water.\n\n\nAbigail pulled up short, her legs separating, and she smiled softly at the creature staring at her in disgust.\n\n\nForty tentacles stretched from a ball of eyes, all shaded in dark blues and purples. The creature looked at her, curling its arms in, as an electrical charge built within them, ready to shock her and then eat her.\n\n\nThe water nymph smiled, and twisted her hands in the air, Vitamancy passing between them, as she focused on the words in her mind.\n\n\nThe creature paused, shocked.\n\n\nAbigail glared, clenching her fists.\n\n\nThe creature shrank back into the depths.\n\n\nShe was not prey.\n\n\nAbigail shot to the surface, spraying water backwards, and she waved to the dryad swimming calmly, barely in sight. He waved back.\n\n\nShe grinned.\n\n\nHere in the water\u2026 She was free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona was far more used to sneaking around, with a bow or a wand.\n\n\nWalking between marching soldiers that made the ground shake with their every step... It was unnerving.\n\n\nIt was terrifying, really.\n\n\nShe was running away, and the soldiers knew it, but they simply didn't care. They had their duty, and they would carry it through to the very end.\n\n\nBut she had a different duty, a different sense of responsibility.\n\n\nShe was the heir to the throne of her father's kingdom, and the threat he posed to the Elvish people was gone. And now\u2026 Now she had to go and prepare them for a coming war.\n\n\nA power race.\n\n\nKyle had proven that anyone could become a Necromancer, with the right amount of preparation.\n\n\nHe had terrified the vampires, shown he had power over them.\n\n\nAnd if the statues that used to be trolls were anything to go by, then he had cursed an entire species.\n\n\nThough thinking about him made her ears turn pink, Kyle was becoming a serious problem. He was on the verge of becoming the sort of dictator that the world had feared since magic had emerged as a mainstream industry.\n\n\nKyle as a crazy evil wizard made Fiona conjure up pictures of the world burning to a crisp.\n\n\nWith many, many dead vampires.\n\n\n\u2026 Could he make them extinct?\n\n\nWould he?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian Duke waded through the waters, slowly and carefully, as was the way of his ancient people.\n\n\nThe dryads were a curious race to most - simply because when they looked at a tree they saw something old and stupid. No true life or essence.\n\n\nThey were\u2026 Wrong.\n\n\nWhen the cold came, the trees prepared for it, creating cavities for the water to freeze in, expelling the rest as mist.\n\n\nWhen the heat came, they lowered the amount of sap in their systems, bleeding out into the air.\n\n\nWhen a river tried to uproot, a tree would play a game of tug of war.\n\n\nTrees were resilient, more than resilient enough to survive the ice age that had decimated their world.\n\n\nHis own people were simply those trees that had decided to ignore the rules of nature, and walk among men.\n\n\nHe and his own kind was a paradox, creatures that should have simply weathered the test of time, and watched on uncaring, but had instead arose in impatience and tried to change the world for the better.\n\n\nHe shuddered at the memory of the war he had fought, long before he had even known that magic existed.\n\n\nYet here he was, yet again, watching the world falling apart.\n\n\nHe waded in the water, knowing that the wisdom of the wise had yet again been abandoned, and a few young people had begun to change the world.\n\n\nIf only they had known the cost of their few actions.\n\n\nThe world could never be the same again, and so they would have to fight to bring it in to the conclusion, they would have to find some sort of bravery within their soul.\n\n\nWould history remember them as heroes or traitorous fools?\n\n\nWho could tell?\n\n\nDuke was lost within his dark brooding thoughts as he slowly crossed the river.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail emerged dripping from the water, breathing hard, and she paused her breath frosted in the air.\n\n\nHer eyes darted around, spotting a nearby cave, their destination, and she saw the dozens of frozen bones lying scattered in front of it.\n\n\nThis was not a good place.\n\n\nShe steadied herself, readying herself for a fight, knowing that here, her magic may be more dangerous than any other tool she could bring to bear - but it was all she had.\n\n\nThe young nymph crouched, eyes flickering as she examined the various spectrums of light.\n\n\nThe cave was sucking the warmth from the world, freezing temperatures surrounding it, and penetrating deep into the rock strata.\n\n\nThere was more than a small of element of magic to it, giant streams echoed from it.\n\n\nAbigail swallowed, clenching her fists.\n\n\nShe did not know if the creature that inhabited that place was home, and if it wasn't, then it would likely kill her before she saw it.\n\n\nWhatever it was\u2026 That was a creature of destruction.\n\n\nA monster of evil.\n\n\nA bastardisation of the laws of nature, corrupted when the Ice Age first began to overtake the world in its hardest fury.\n\n\nAbigail winced as a blast of frozen air blew snow into her face, and she spun around behind, swearing violently and dropping to the ground as a fist as large as her body ripped through the space she had inhabited.\n\n\nShe used her wrists to flip backwards through the air, wincing as she felt the cold of the cave behind her.\n\n\nIt was hunting her, driving it towards a place she had no hope of escaping.\n\n\nShe gritted her teeth, concentrating and forcing the incantations out in her mind, gripping the ground beneath the beast of ice and snow.\n\n\nMoaning faces emerged, accompanied by groaning arms, seizing hold of the creature.\n\n\nShe twisted a fist and pushed it down, the ground beneath the beast opening into a yawing mouth, but it shook off her attack, kicking as it strode forward, shattering the souls she had embedded into the ground.\n\n\nAbigail stared at the beast, towering high above her.\n\n\nIcicles laid across it like scales, snow spilling down between them like puss from rotting meat. Its eyes were little more than empty sockets carved into a dome of ice, empty and lifeless.\n\n\nAbigail's face twitched into a smile, and she spun a ball of Vitamancy, pushing it forward with all her might.\n\n\nIt struck the beast at speed, and slammed to a stop, the force knocking Abigail backwards a foot across the ground, she clenched her teeth and stood her ground, fighting to push the essence of life into the creature.\n\n\nSomething dark latched onto the Vitamancy, trying to push back.\n\n\nAbigail felt herself tumbling to the ground, except it was now gone, and she was falling head over heels down a dark abyss.\n\n\nHer every thought became a nightmare, taking flight and attacking her, tearing at her soul, trying to rip her apart and end her life.\n\n\nShe was gone.\n\n\nHer soul was almost destroyed.\n\n\nShe was becoming death.\n\n\nAnd the Reaper from ancient terrors rose up, taking hold of her, and she took hold of it, wresting the scythe away.\n\n\nShe stood in shadow, feeling a dark surety settling over her.\n\n\nShe was Death.\n\n\nAbigail let out a yell of fury, and the creature in front of her exploded, sending icicles slamming into the ground and air.\n\n\nShe collapsed to her knees, hands on the frozen ground, breathing hard.\n\n\nWhat the crap had just happened?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona trudged through the snow, surrounding her up to her waist.\n\n\nShe could feel small crystals of water forming on the ends of her hair, the frost pasted across her face, hidden by little more than a scrap of cloth.\n\n\nShe pushed forward through it all, and felt no fear.\n\n\nThe elements might be conspiring against her, but she had a duty to perform.\n\n\nShe had to return to her people.\n\n\nKeep them safe.\n\n\nThe whole world was about to erupt into chaos.\n\n\nThe moment the sun set, the vampires would come out, seeking revenge and destruction.\n\n\nIt was an impossible deadline for her, nearly a week from her kingdom, but she needed to cover as much ground as possible, and take cover for the night.\n\n\nA thundering voice spoke from nearby, \"You are about to succumb to the cold. Your health is beginning to fail.\"\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes.\n\n\nAs if she hadn't noticed the way she trembled, or the way her breath rasped.\n\n\n\"There's nowhere to take cover, yet.\" She set her jaw, \"We keep going.\"\n\n\nA rocky hand grabbed her shoulder, and Fiona's eyes bulged as she felt herself simply jerk to a stop. She looked up at the owner of the hand and he shook his head, \"There is a system of caverns beneath us.\"\n\n\nHe turned and signalled to the other soldiers, and they immediately began to pummel the ground, throwing up snow and stone, and Fiona looked in astonishment as they began to get lower, somehow managing to dig.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle looked at the council of men he had gathered together.\n\n\nThey had all come, of their own volition, to try and remove him from the world.\n\n\nNow?\n\n\nKyle smiled and looked at the document laid out on the table in front of him.\n\n\nIt was a charter, that he and the others had been arguing and discussing for nearly a full day - but it was nearly complete.\n\n\nAn agreement that might see an end to the war that had decimated the school - and an end to the wars that had kept the world on its knees since the ice had destroyed it.\n\n\nKyle held out his hand over the paper, and cut it with a knife. Squeezing his fist so that several drops struck the paper.\n\n\nHis spell immediately took hold, and Kyle winced as he felt the unbreakable vow take shape.\n\n\nHe looked up, and smiled softly, \"Who's next?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandice Silvergate collapsed, shaking involuntarily from the cold.\n\n\nHer once perfect black hair was torn in places, burned in others. But if you swept your gaze down, passed the brow with her silver fringe, you would see two eyes full of wrath and abandon.\n\n\nShe shivered, holding her hands together, muttering urgently, trying to use her anger to focus as the hypothermia tried to rob her of her reason.\n\n\nAt length sparks appeared, but the elation on her face was short lived as a flame failed to take form.\n\n\nThe young mage clenched her fists, fighting back tears of frustration and terror.\n\n\nShe had fled across the mountains, pursued by vampires which she had somehow managed to trap and kill. She still wasn't sure if she had any luck left on her side.\n\n\nJudging by the lack of fire, she'd used it all up.\n\n\nShe pushed her frozen hands against the soil, speaking hurriedly through chattering teeth, \"Crescere calor, glaciem pugnam. Crescere calor, galciem pugnam.\"\n\n\nThe ground warmed for a moment, the snow beginning to melt, but that was all.\n\n\nThe young mage fought back tears, and stood up, looking through the sweeping snow, barely allowing her to see a couple feet in front of her face.\n\n\nShe closed her eyes and breathed out heavily.\n\n\nShe was going to die.",

He waded in the water, knowing that the wisdom of the wise had yet again been abandoned, and a few young people had begun to change the world.  If only they had known the cost of their few actions.  The world could never be the same again, and so they would have to fight to bring it in to the conclusion, they would have to find some sort of bravery within their soul.  Would history remember them as heroes or traitorous fools?  Who could tell?  Duke was lost within his dark brooding thoughts as he slowly crossed the river.    Abigail emerged dripping from the water, breathing hard, and she paused her breath frosted in the air.  Her eyes darted around, spotting a nearby cave, their destination, and she saw the dozens of frozen bones lying scattered in front of it.  This was not a good place.  She steadied herself, readying herself for a fight, knowing that here, her magic may be more dangerous than any other tool she could bring to bear - but it was all she had.  The young nymph crouched, eyes flickering as she examined the various spectrums of light.  The cave was sucking the warmth from the world, freezing temperatures surrounding it, and penetrating deep into the rock strata.  There was more than a small of element of magic to it, giant streams echoed from it.  Abigail swallowed, clenching her fists.  She did not know if the creature that inhabited that place was home, and if it wasn't, then it would likely kill her before she saw it.  Whatever it was\u2026 That was a creature of destruction.  A monster of evil.  A bastardisation of the laws of nature, corrupted when the Ice Age first began to overtake the world in its hardest fury.  Abigail winced as a blast of frozen air blew snow into her face, and she spun around behind, swearing violently and dropping to the ground as a fist as large as her body ripped through the space she had inhabited.  She used her wrists to flip backwards through the air, wincing as she felt the cold of the cave behind her.  It was hunting her, driving it towards a place she had no hope of escaping.  She gritted her teeth, concentrating and forcing the incantations out in her mind, gripping the ground beneath the beast of ice and snow.  Moaning faces emerged, accompanied by groaning arms, seizing hold of the creature.  She twisted a fist and pushed it down, the ground beneath the beast opening into a yawing mouth, but it shook off her attack, kicking as it strode forward, shattering the souls she had embedded into the ground.  Abigail stared at the beast, towering high above her.  Icicles laid across it like scales, snow spilling down between them like puss from rotting meat. Its eyes were little more than empty sockets carved into a dome of ice, empty and lifeless.  Abigail's face twitched into a smile, and she spun a ball of Vitamancy, pushing it forward with all her might.  It struck the beast at speed, and slammed to a stop, the force knocking Abigail backwards a foot across the ground, she clenched her teeth and stood her ground, fighting to push the essence of life into the creature.  Something dark latched onto the Vitamancy, trying to push back.  Abigail felt herself tumbling to the ground, except it was now gone, and she was falling head over heels down a dark abyss.  Her every thought became a nightmare, taking flight and attacking her, tearing at her soul, trying to rip her apart and end her life.  She was gone.  Her soul was almost destroyed.  She was becoming death.  And the Reaper from ancient terrors rose up, taking hold of her, and she took hold of it, wresting the scythe away.  She stood in shadow, feeling a dark surety settling over her.  She was Death.  Abigail let out a yell of fury, and the creature in front of her exploded, sending icicles slamming into the ground and air.  She collapsed to her knees, hands on the frozen ground, breathing hard.  What the crap had just happened?    Fiona trudged through the snow, surrounding her up to her waist.  She could feel small crystals of water forming on the ends of her hair, the frost pasted across her face, hidden by little more than a scrap of cloth.  She pushed forward through it all, and felt no fear.  The elements might be conspiring against her, but she had a duty to perform.  She had to return to her people.  Keep them safe.  The whole world was about to erupt into chaos.  The moment the sun set, the vampires would come out, seeking revenge and destruction.  It was an impossible deadline for her, nearly a week from her kingdom, but she needed to cover as much ground as possible, and take cover for the night.  A thundering voice spoke from nearby, \"You are about to succumb to the cold. Your health is beginning to fail.\"  She rolled her eyes.

She looked up at the owner of the hand and he shook his head, \"There is a system of caverns beneath us.\"  He turned and signalled to the other soldiers, and they immediately began to pummel the ground, throwing up snow and stone, and Fiona looked in astonishment as they began to get lower, somehow managing to dig.    Kyle looked at the council of men he had gathered together.  They had all come, of their own volition, to try and remove him from the world.  Now?  Kyle smiled and looked at the document laid out on the table in front of him.  It was a charter, that he and the others had been arguing and discussing for nearly a full day - but it was nearly complete.  An agreement that might see an end to the war that had decimated the school - and an end to the wars that had kept the world on its knees since the ice had destroyed it.  Kyle held out his hand over the paper, and cut it with a knife. Squeezing his fist so that several drops struck the paper.

He spoke loudly, hoping the girl on her hands and knees could comprehend him, \"Are you okay, Miss Ignis?\" \n\n\nHe heard her laugh bitterly, and the crunch of ice as she stood up, \"Sure. I just somehow managed to kill something that should never existed by seeing something that can't have happened, I'm totally fine.\" \n\n\nAdrian extended a root delicately towards the cave, watching the magical energy washing over it, and he grimaced. He chanced a look back at the nymph, and saw the lack of injury. \n\n\nHis eyes swept back and he shrugged, \"At least you have maintained your sense of humour... This cave is still not safe.\" \n\n\nThe nymph shook her head, crystals of ice in her hair jangling, \"Uh uh.

Crazy idea.\" The nymph shivered violently, \"Think I gave myself a hallucination.\" \n\n\nAdrian winced, knowing the possibilities, \"What sort of hallucination?\" \n\n\n\"Uh... I was the embodiment of death. Used my scythe to gut the creature...\" She spoke nervously, trying to hide her anxiety. \n\n\nAdrian turned around in surprise, \"Say what?\" \n\n\nIt wasn't one of the possibilities that he had considered. \n\n\nThen he felt something seize his questing root, and the world vanished from sight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona yawned, sitting up slowly, instinctively reaching for a bow that was no longer there. \n\n\nHer elven eyes darted around the cave, acknowledging the presence and source of each shadow, and she shook her head. \n\n\nIt wasn't a nightmare. \n\n\nThe school really as gone - destroyed in a war to find, capture and eliminate the threat that a kid she had known for a couple of days might pose. \n\n\nKyle Kilroy. \n\n\nHis face appeared in her mind, laughing tiredly, his eyes lit up with an intelligence that had intrigued her from the first moment. \n\n\nHell... Where was Kyle? \n\n\nHad he abandoned his crazy idea of bringing the world to peace? Or was he still trying to save a world that had been destroyed by a thousand generations of the past? \n\n\nFiona smiled. \n\n\nKyle wasn't about to let anyone else have the fun. \n\n\nShe stood up, and the soldiers snapped to attention, and alarm bells sang out in Fiona's head. \n\n\nOne of the shadows hadn't moved. \n\n\nThere was one more shadow than there were statues. \n\n\nShe stomped her foot, yelling, \"Solve lapis! Intrusus occidere! Solve lapis, intrusus occidere!\" \n\n\nStone shattered, and the shadow fell fluidly to the ground, reshaping, just as the floor exploded upwards. Yet somehow, the form of the creature simply stepped through the shrapnel, moving at impossible speed and angles, stepping into the light. \n\n\nThe creature howled in agony, stepping backwards, and Fiona smiled, \"Don't like the sunlight, vampire?\" \n\n\nThe creature hissed at her from the dark, and then an envelope hit the ground in front of her. Fiona picked it up gingerly and opened it, trusting to her bodyguards. \n\n\n\n\n\"Dear Fiona Applesilver, \n\n\nThis war has taken a toll, and though we have become separated, I need you to know that I am looking forward to the day I can see you again. \n\n\nPeace has been found. \n\n\nOr a semblance of peace. \n\n\nI have managed to convince the three human nations, New Rome, Balsa, and Malata, to sign a charter along with myself. It's a treaty. We will rebuild the school, and protect each other. The Trolls are somewhat pissy with me, due to being cursed. No sunlight for them. As to the vampires? We have declared war on their homeland. \n\n\nHowever, to finish this treaty, we need a representative from your homeland. \n\n\nWe need to finish the Draco Charter, bound in an unbreakable vow, with blood, by someone who rules in your homeland. \n\n\nFi... I hate to ask... But should it be you? \n\n\nLet the vampire know. He can't hurt you, something to do with the fact that his soul is my plaything. \n\n\nLet me know quickly, these people are really angry, and ready to lash out. \n\n\nSo it's the war march soon. \n\n\nKyle, \n\n\nAlways, your friend.\"\n\n\nFiona stared at the letter and lowered it slowly, \"Tell Kyle... Tell him I have a priority to protect my nation. Even from him.\" \n\n\nThe vampire laughed, and then it was gone. \n\n\nFiona clenched her fists, \"Let's go. Now.\" \n\n\nShe was flung up into the open, and she hit the snowy ground running, knowing that time was no longer on her side. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntonio sighed heavily, looking at the remnants of his camp.\n\n\nThe trolls, vampires and elves had certainly done their job.\n\n\nHis men were moving around, repairing tents, carting bodies, and salvaging what they could. Coals were strewn across the ground near the blacksmith's tent, swords were scattered near the armoury, and the shatter toothpicks nearby were the remains of his army's supply for arrows.\n\n\nAntonio walked over to his tent with a sigh of frustration, unstrapping his armour as he entered, dropping the chest piece to his left, just as he realised his mistake.\n\n\nA small, very sharp, and somewhat shiny blade appeared in his peripheral, and streaked towards him.\n\n\nAntonio spun, blocking the blow with his armoured arm, and gasped as he felt a second blade ram through his unprotected torso.\n\n\nHe struggled, fighting, and then he collapsed onto his knees, his mouth dribbling blood as he glared up at his assassin.\n\n\nThey nodded slowly, surprised, \"That was strength, General\u2026 But it was also stupid.\"\n\n\nAntonio collapsed backwards, the world going black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel sighed heavily as he sat on the edge of his hammock, thinking hard.\n\n\nHe had come all the way from Balsa to make an ally out of Kyle Kilroy, and though his hand was bandaged, having sworn a vow of alliance\u2026 Kyle was far from a friend to Balsa.\n\n\nNothing he could think of would influence the young Necromancer in any way that he might consider\u2026 Safe.\n\n\nThe general paused, frowning as he noticed a set of dusty scuff marks by the entry to the tent, and he winced, clenching his fists.\n\n\nThe marks were smaller than any soldiers boot.\n\n\nEmmanuel focused, and began to speak, flames spouting from his hands, \"Quaerere intrusus, adolebit -\"\n\n\nHe cut off, gasping, as blood poured from his throat, a small dark sticking out of where his voice box had been, and he tumbled forward onto the ground, his hands spasming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamien yelled angrily, kicking a helmet across the campsite.\n\n\nThe general clenched his teeth, and tried to calm himself, feeling the eyes of his soldiers as they tried to avoid staring at him.\n\n\nDamien spat on the ground, and then turned, and looked around at the soldiers, \"Children!\"\n\n\nHe smiled and shrugged, \"Children, gather around. Let me tell you a story.\"\n\n\nHis soldiers began to move slowly and Damien shrugged, \"There was once a world. It was destroyed by ice and stupidity. Out of this world though, life flourished. It survived.\"\n\n\nHe sighed and shook his head, \"But this is where our story goes wrong. A man who died, crawled back to life. He brought the shadows of the Other Side here, and turned himself into a god.\"\n\n\nDamien clenched his fist, \"This man has bound our nation, he has forced his hand against Malata, and we are now bound as his protector, and servant. It is the unbreakable vow.\"\n\n\nHe could see the emotions staring in his men, and he smiled coyly, \"Yet, our queen foresee this. Our queen, had me swear an unbreakable vow before we came to this land. So I could not be bound by another unbreakable vow.\"\n\n\nDamien smiled softly and shook his head, \"We are not bound by the so-called Draco Charter. We do not need to remember the beast that was both man and dragon. We do not need to serve the dead.\"\n\n\nHis soldiers thrust their weapons in the air with a shout and Damien shook his head, \"By neither can we fight this threat. You cannot kill that which has power over death. Today\u2026 We return to Malata, to protect it against the coming war\u2026 For war has already arrived.\"\n\n\nDamien nodded, \"For Malata! For our -\"\n\n\nThe general's eyes bulged, and his left cheek twitched. His throat had stopped working altogether. He couldn't speak\u2026 He couldn't breathe.\n\n\nHe fell onto his knees, his hands too heavy to lift to his neck.\n\n\nAnd then he fell forwards onto his face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandice blinked blearily, fighting back a yawn as confusion washed over her.\n\n\nShe scratched her head and sat up, pulling a bear rug off herself, as she stared around at the leather tent.\n\n\nShe had been\u2026 Dying.\n\n\nSurrounded by snow and ice.\n\n\nAnd now she was in a tent, alone.\n\n\nShe stood up, clenching her fists, and then her face went bright red, as she realised that she hadn't been wearing anything whilst in the bed.\n\n\nShe grabbed the bear rug and wrapped it around herself, and stepped out of the tent awkwardly under the weight, and looked around the frozen landscape.\n\n\nShe saw a lone figure sitting cross-legged beside a hole in the ice, chanting over the water.\n\n\nCandice glared at them.\n\n\nThey'd taken her clothes, what else had they done to her?\n\n\nThe figure burst out laughing and spun around, \"I'm a Vitamancer, Miss Silvergate!\"\n\n\nShe blinked in shock, recognising them, \"Professor Gallagher.\"\n\n\nThe woman shrugged, and stood up, \"Nice to see you up and about. It was touch and go for a while there, I'm not much of a practiced hand with Sanamancy.\"\n\n\nCandice swallowed, \"What happened to my clothes?\"\n\n\nBrioni Gallagher rolled her eyes, \"You were in the snow. Wet. I was trying to make sure you didn't die.\"\n\n\nCandice smiled weakly, \"Right\u2026 And now?\"\n\n\nThe professor frowned, \"They make up part of the tent. If you can get a fire going, we can dry them out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Isaac opened his eyes slowly, feeling like he was crumbling.\n\n\nDust poured from his joints and his jaw creaked slowly. The troll slowly shook himself, fighting back his anger.\n\n\nHe had not been dead, nor asleep when the stone overtook his body.\n\n\nHe had been encased, imprisoned.\n\n\nHis people had lain there, cursed, whilst the group had quibbled and fought over their petty words.\n\n\nThe Draco Charter.\n\n\nThat piece of paper did not bind him, and Isaac Isaac felt a great feeling stealing over him, an anger with an edge to it, that no troll had felt in centuries.\n\n\nIt brought forth feelings of intelligence and the deep dark within the troll's soul.\n\n\nHe struggled to comprehend this new feeling as it gave flight to a myriad of thoughts and fancies, ways in which he could end those that had ignored the plight of his people.\n\n\n\"That would be called 'vengeance', Isaac Isaac.\"\n\n\nThe troll glared at the small individual standing nearby, and then his face curved upwards into a smile, \"Adrian.\"\n\n\nThe golem shrugged slowly, \"To kill one such as ourselves, is not a task that many find easy.\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac clenched his fists suddenly, the rocks of his form scraping together, \"I will destroy Kyle Kilroy.\"\n\n\nAdrian frowned, \"Really? How would you kill him?\"\n\n\nThe troll shook his head, \"No professor. Not kill. Destroy. Take what he cares about. Break the school. Kill the elf and nymph. Kyle Kilroy will be the only one to kill Kyle Kilroy.\"\n\n\nThe golem nodded slowly, \"Be careful, Isaac Isaac. You may awaken the same feeling you have now, in his heart.\"\n\n\n\"I will eat his heart!\" The troll roared, the building shaking, \"I will drink his tears and grind his bones to make my bread! That nothing who calls himself Necromancer will dream of the day he first died!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle glared at the vampire screaming on the ground in front of him.\n\n\nIt wasn't the vampire's fault, of course.\n\n\nHe was just the messenger.\n\n\nBut Kyle was pissed, and wanted to take it out on someone.\n\n\nThe foul concoction of nature that vampires were provided him with all the excuse in the universe that he wanted.\n\n\nSo it screamed and writhed, soothing the flames of betrayal.\n\n\nHe sighed, and muttered a spell, a map of the world appearing in front of him, and Kyle twisted it, and zoomed in on a particular place, frowning as he saw footsteps fading in the snow.\n\n\nFiona was running away, but the creatures that were born to guard the school were trailing her.\n\n\nProtecting her?\n\n\nKyle scratched his head, he didn't know enough history of the place.\n\n\nHe turned to his fuming advisor, and shrugged, \"Any idea why the statues would turn into Fi's bodyguards?\"\n\n\nThe advisor shook his head, \"You've come a long way down from where I left you, boy... If I had any notion of what you would become, I would have handed you over, rather than die defending you.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed heavily, and the screaming cut off, \"I was frustrated. Vampires don't matter.\"\n\n\nBellum nodded slowly, \"Then why do you have to keep telling yourself that?\"\n\n\nKyle blinked and winced, struggling for an answer and he shook his head, \"Because I'm a fool.\"\n\n\nThe half-dragon Headmaster blinked, \"So, you're capable of learning wisdom, then. That's a good sign.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled tautly, \"I'm older than you, Bellum, even if I wasn't before you died.\"\n\n\n\"Age is nothing without experience.\" Draco snorted, \"What you have, Kyle, is talent. You have talent, but not wisdom. That comes from experience. From being betrayed, from making the wrong choices. From making an utter idiot of yourself, and then having to fix what you did... And learning you can't always.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded slowly, \"Thank you, Headmaster.\"\n\n\nBellum blinked, \"Not anymore. In answer to your earlier question, the magic of the school seeks out a replacement Headmaster, the moment the current dies. It found one to replace me, and though she doesn't know it yet, she is bound to this school. She has no choice in the matter.\"\n\n\nKyle looked back at the map, \"Fi hates me... She wants what I'm doing to fail... I've changed too much.\"\n\n\nThere was a sharp crack and Kyle started, rubbing the back of his head where the tip of Draco's tail had whipped him, and the old professor rolled his eyes, \"That's love talking, boy. Not the voice of a leader.\"\n\n\nThe Ventusamancer walked forward, looking at the ruins of the school, \"Because, like it or not, you are a leader now, Kyle. Your personal concerns, don't matter. You've put yourself at the head of a new nation, and tried to bend the rest to your will. This will take cunning, skill, and a darker soul than you have, to make sure that the world doesn't tear itself to pieces trying to find a way to kill you.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, thinking, and then nodded, \"Then we need a failsafe. A balance, to keep me in check and give them a sense of security, for now.\"\n\n\nDraco turned to him, \"What are you suggesting, boy?\"\n\n\n\"A weakness.\" Kyle sighed heavily, and winced, \"I don't trust you, Headmaster... But I don't have a choice here. When the curse I'm about to cast takes me, I trust you to care for this new nation, and to watch over Fiona and Abigail.\"\n\n\nDraco blinked, \"Why not bind me with an oath?\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"Then you would hunt for a way around it. Not a way to make what I have done, better.\"\n\n\nBellum nodded slowly, \"What curse?\"\n\n\nKyle winced and shrugged, \"What other? I curse myself to take part in the curse of the trolls.\"\n\n\nA puff of dust washed over him, and Kyle swallowed, \"Only four hours till sunrise. Let's get this place in order.\"",

He spoke loudly, hoping the girl on her hands and knees could comprehend him, \"Are you okay, Miss Ignis?\"   He heard her laugh bitterly, and the crunch of ice as she stood up, \"Sure. I just somehow managed to kill something that should never existed by seeing something that can't have happened, I'm totally fine.\"   Adrian extended a root delicately towards the cave, watching the magical energy washing over it, and he grimaced. He chanced a look back at the nymph, and saw the lack of injury.   His eyes swept back and he shrugged, \"At least you have maintained your sense of humour... This cave is still not safe.\"   The nymph shook her head, crystals of ice in her hair jangling, \"Uh uh. You've got this one, professor.\"   Adrian frowned, \"How did you survive, Miss Ignis?\"   \"Not a damn clue. I tried to give the thing a soul... Crazy idea.\" The nymph shivered violently, \"Think I gave myself a hallucination.\"   Adrian winced, knowing the possibilities, \"What sort of hallucination?\"   \"Uh... I was the embodiment of death. Used my scythe to gut the creature...\" She spoke nervously, trying to hide her anxiety.   Adrian turned around in surprise, \"Say what?\"   It wasn't one of the possibilities that he had considered.   Then he felt something seize his questing root, and the world vanished from sight.     Fiona yawned, sitting up slowly, instinctively reaching for a bow that was no longer there.   Her elven eyes darted around the cave, acknowledging the presence and source of each shadow, and she shook her head.   It wasn't a nightmare.   The school really as gone - destroyed in a war to find, capture and eliminate the threat that a kid she had known for a couple of days might pose.   Kyle Kilroy.   His face appeared in her mind, laughing tiredly, his eyes lit up with an intelligence that had intrigued her from the first moment.   Hell... Where was Kyle?   Had he abandoned his crazy idea of bringing the world to peace? Or was he still trying to save a world that had been destroyed by a thousand generations of the past?   Fiona smiled.   Kyle wasn't about to let anyone else have the fun.   She stood up, and the soldiers snapped to attention, and alarm bells sang out in Fiona's head.   One of the shadows hadn't moved.   There was one more shadow than there were statues.   She stomped her foot, yelling, \"Solve lapis! Intrusus occidere! Solve lapis, intrusus occidere!\"   Stone shattered, and the shadow fell fluidly to the ground, reshaping, just as the floor exploded upwards. Yet somehow, the form of the creature simply stepped through the shrapnel, moving at impossible speed and angles, stepping into the light.   The creature howled in agony, stepping backwards, and Fiona smiled, \"Don't like the sunlight, vampire?\"   The creature hissed at her from the dark, and then an envelope hit the ground in front of her. Fiona picked it up gingerly and opened it, trusting to her bodyguards.    \"Dear Fiona Applesilver,   This war has taken a toll, and though we have become separated, I need you to know that I am looking forward to the day I can see you again.

Not a way to make what I have done, better.\"  Bellum nodded slowly, \"What curse?\"  Kyle winced and shrugged, \"What other? I curse myself to take part in the curse of the trolls.\"  A puff of dust washed over him, and Kyle swallowed, \"Only four hours till sunrise. Let's get this place in order.\"",

I spent most of it at the front... What happened?\"\n\n\nCandice laughed bitterly, \"A vampire came looking for Fiona Applesilver.\"\n\n\nBrioni winced, \"Vampires... That's not something anyone ever likes to see... They're... Pitiless.\"\n\n\nCandice glanced up, \"I turned him to ash. The problem came when others tried to find what happened to him... They turned my room into a bath.\"\n\n\nBrioni frowned, about to question, when she understood.\n\n\nThe professor winced, \"How did you escape?\"\n\n\nCandice sighed heavily, \"I burst into flames... I don't really remember how I did it... Ended up on the shore, in the snow, looking at the school, so I ran.\"\n\n\nBrioni nodded, \"A wise move.\"\n\n\nCandice spat on the ground, \"The move of a coward. I am a damn Silvergate. The oldest human warrior mage clan. I shamed my family, and my friends died. There is no mercy to surviving.\"\n\n\nBrioni frowned, nervous, \"And now?\"\n\n\nCandice glanced at her curiously, \"I'm headed to my clan. Kyle Kilroy has started a war with vampires.\"\n\n\nBrioni shrugged, \"I've never paid much attention to politics.\"\n\n\nCandice rolled her eyes, \"It isn't politics. You live or die by what the Silvergate clan does. We patrol the borders to the Shadowlands. Kilroy has upset the balance, and so my clan will have paid the price.\"\n\n\nBrioni nodded slowly, \"There is something you should know, however. Kyle Kilroy's parents were massacred by vampires.\"\n\n\nCandice smiled, \"If Kyle is willing to take the war to the heart of the Shadowlands the Silvergate clan will back him to the final extermination of those beasts.\"\n\n\nBrioni frowned, \"When did you see your first vampire?\"\n\n\nCandice winced, her eyes glazing, \"I was four. It ate my mother in front of me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Isaac yelled loudly, his voice bellowing down the hallways as he shattered the brickwork that was once a doorway.\n\n\nHe shattered pillars, smashed in doors and splintered furniture as he stormed through the castle.\n\n\nThe troll was struggling to keep his anger in check. The drunk haze of the will to kill was descending on him.\n\n\nHe could hear similar war cries from other trolls throughout the grounds and castle, but he had yet to see another of his kind.\n\n\nThe golem had disappeared, he wasn't sure when.\n\n\nHe headbutted his way through a wall, spying a man on the other side, and bellowed into his face, covering him in spittle and small gemstones.\n\n\nThe man calmly wiped his face, looked up at Isaac Isaac and clenched a fist.\n\n\nAn invisible force slammed into him, and he fell to the ground, feeling a box shrinking around him, crushing him. The young human sighed, and then the skin flickered, tiny scales appearing for a brief moment.\n\n\nThe nymph smiled and swept his long black hair back, \"Troll, by the order of my king, Kyle Kilroy, I am to escort you from the premises. Be warned, if you return, I will gladly delight in killing you.\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac sneered, \"Tell Kyle I will eat his flesh.\"\n\n\nThe nymph blinked in surprise, \"Maybe I will... But just so you know, Isaac Isaac, Kyle has your curse as well. Something to do with making politicians happy. I didn't really listen. But he turns to stone too.\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac blinked as the nymph's magic elevated him out a nearby window, \"I am still going to destroy him.\"\n\n\nThe nymph shrugged, and then the magic vanished and the troll tumbled as he fell towards the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuke groaned, sitting up slowly, his roots rebinding together from a lumpen mass into his more familiar form. He took stock of his surroundings, patiently waiting for his memory to return.\n\n\nHe was in a cave, made of ice. Grown from ice.\n\n\nIt was a place of magic and danger.\n\n\nDuke winced as he remembered Abigail screaming and tearing the soul of the ice golem to pieces.\n\n\nWhat she had done was the worst thing he had ever witnessed, but he should have seen it coming. Abigail's secondary magic, the one she kept hidden from everyone around her, was dark and twisted.\n\n\nThat being said, the prophecy that she would need it to save Kyle, Fiona or herself\u2026 He was disturbed by how strong that had been.\n\n\nDuke stood up, clenching his fists and looking for a sign of his captor, in all likelihood nothing more than another ice golem.\n\n\nYet\u2026 How had an ice golem managed to take him by surprise?\n\n\nA shiver went through him, and he swallowed, \"Madame?\"\n\n\nThe room filled with fog, and a female voice laughed all around him, and he cringed.\n\n\n\"I have no qualm with you. I seek nothing but shelter, and will continue on my way.\" Duke spoke firmly, tensing.\n\n\nTwo hands grabbed his head as a skeleton screamed in his face, \"Give me back my son!\"\n\n\nDuke stumbled as it was gone, and the fog faded, leaving him seemingly alone.\n\n\nHe sighed and intoned quietly, the room vibrating dangerously, \"Wake tenebris anima , nympha, et atteritis me gratis!\"\n\n\nThere was a soft popping sound, and two individuals appeared.\n\n\nOne was as old as time, a female skeleton, still wearing that tattered clothes of her last life, her fists clenched, as she glared at the other newcomer, shaking with power.\n\n\nThe other looked from the skeleton to Duke and back, truly terrified.\n\n\nAbigail swallowed nervously, \"What the crap, professor?\"\n\n\nDuke winced, clenching his fists, \"You destroyed her son's soul.\"\n\n\nThe skeleton let out a roar of rage and the contents of the cave slammed towards Abigail in a moment of complete chaos, as the rules that governed the planes of existence that he could see swerved, pulled by the sheer force of magic.\n\n\nYet, as the magic slammed towards the nymph, her eyes sharpened, and she rolled to the side. She reached into the void of magic heading towards her, and lit a tiny spark.\n\n\nThe spark immediately flowed across the magic, lighting up a fire Ventusamancy, and the room turned slowly, protecting its mother.\n\n\nAbigail stood up, dusting herself off, and she looked to the Soul Madame, and winced, \"I am truly sorry. But now, I'm leaving.\"\n\n\nDuke closed his eyes, reaching out to Abigail, and seized the both of them, ripping them apart till they were nothing but atoms.\n\n\nHe appeared by the river, outside the snow, and he let out a ragged gasp, and Abigail shoved him, \"What in the Shades, was that?\"\n\n\nDuke glanced at her, \"Summoning you to distract a Soul Madame? I would call it a prudent move.\"\n\n\n\"You didn't just summon me!\" She yelled, her scales turning black, her head a fiery red, and her eyes turned into pearls. She clenched her fists, fighting back tears, \"I saw the Other Side.\"\n\n\nThe professor stared at her, all his fears realised, and he shook his head slowly, \"I am sorry, so sorry\u2026 But that was not me\u2026\"\n\n\nShe reverted to normal, collapsing on the sand, hugging herself as tears flowed down her face, \"I'm not crazy\u2026 I'm not crazy\u2026\"\n\n\nHe didn't say anything.\n\n\nThe truth was far worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle paced the room, both scared and angry.\n\n\nFour men were in the room with him, his half-dragon advisor lounging in a nearby chair, and three ashamed men on their knees, just staring at the ground.\n\n\nKyle paused and looked over to them, \"I know you are still suffering the side-effects of\u2026 Well\u2026 Dying. That being said, each and every one of you were murdered, nearly simultaneously. Assassinated, really. Your assassins are threats to the fragile peace we have established\u2026 And I have enough on my plate with every vampire wanting to tear out my throat.\"\n\n\nThe three generals didn't even react, and Kyle sighed, throwing up his hands, \"I tried the nice way. Draco?\"\n\n\nHis advisor sighed and stood up slowly, walking over to the men and crouched in front of them, \"Unfortunately, I agree with our impetuous young Necromancer\u2026 We need to know about this threat. Maybe he'll even let you die afterwards.\"\n\n\nAll three looked up at him terror, the blood draining from their faces and Draco blinked, \"Or maybe we won't send you back\u2026 Please talk. I know the Truth Spell, and it is far from kind on an individual.\"\n\n\nThe three shook their heads, and looked down again.\n\n\nDraco sighed and stood up, \"Ignorance is bliss, Kyle.\"\n\n\nHe glare at his advisor, \"We need to know. Without knowing\u2026 We'll be burned and beaten.\"\n\n\nDraco nodded and closed, his eyes focusing, and then he drew his wand, flicking it in time with his chanting, \"Solvite et linguis quae ad nos nunc veritatem.\"\n\n\nAll three screamed and tumbled backwards onto the ground as all ability to deceive or resist questioning was torn from them. Kyle winced, understanding the cruelty of the Truth Spell. It tore the soul.\n\n\nHe sighed heavily, \"Guerra?\"\n\n\nThe New Roman general staggered back to his knees and shook his head, \"May you burn in the deepest hell, Kilroy.\"\n\n\nThe Necromancer clenched a fist, \"Who killed you?\"\n\n\nAntonio's head twitched, trying to fight the spell, and he hissed through gritted teeth, \"An assassin with a blade.\"\n\n\nKilroy rolled his eyes, \"I know that. Did you see their face?\"\n\n\nThe general punched the stone slabs, trying to fight, \"I did not.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"Hear their voice?\"\n\n\nThe general's face went white, \"Y\u2026 Y\u2026 Ye\u2026 Yes.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled and nodded, \"Excellent. What did you recognise about the voice?\"\n\n\nAntonio yelled in anger, launching to his feet, \"What is the point of this? I died! Why did you drag me through hell back into the living world?\"\n\n\nKyle clenched a fist, and the room went dark, \"Isto.\"\n\n\nThe general sighed, \"The truth? Truth is that I am dead and belong not to this world. You have unbalanced the world, and it will come to destroy you.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Who killed you?\"\n\n\nThe general glared, \"An elvish assassin.\"\n\n\nKyle blinked, \"You two? Same?\"\n\n\nEmmanuel shook his head, \"Pixie.\"\n\n\nKyle glanced over to the last, and Damien shook his head, \"I did not see.\"\n\n\nThe Necromancer winced, \"Awesome. An alliance to kill me\u2026 You have a choice. I will either kill you again, or you three will return to lead your armies. Remind them that a Necromancer leads now, death is unnecessary.\"\n\n\n\"Die!\" All three shouted at once and Kyle nodded, \"So be it.\"\n\n\nHe clicked his fingers and their souls vanished back into the abyss he had stolen them from, and he winced, glancing at Draco, \"Elves and Pixies working together? What would the third be?\"\n\n\nThe ex-Headmaster shook his head, \"I only know of one alliance like this\u2026 An ancient one. Back before man knew how to handle magic. They almost exterminated us. If that alliance has been revived\u2026 Kiss your ass goodbye.\"\n\n\nKyle scratched his head, \"What alliance?\"\n\n\n\"Elf, Pixie and Dwarf.\" Draco spoke slowly and shrugged, \"The original Bloodbound Pact.\"\n\n\nKyle's face went white, \"Dwarves don't interfere with the surface world.\"\n\n\nDraco shrugged, \"Hopefully they still don't. This is one incident. It could easily be just two assassins from different histories. There is no way to tell what is happening here. We need more information before making any decisions.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded slowly, \"Fi.\"\n\n\nDraco paused, \"She's bound by magic to protect her nation Kyle. You are a threat. You need to make a deal with her, before you can call her an ally.\"\n\n\nKyle rubbed his face and sighed, \"I guess I have to go talk to her.\"\n\n\nDraco blinked, \"How? She's got a two-day head start on you.\"\n\n\nHe smiled softly, \"Been working on a variation of dispersion and reconstitution.\" He smiled, pulling himself apart and reconstituting nearby, \"This is the normal way. It needs a couple things. Firstly, you need to see where you're going, otherwise you end up with something inside you. Secondly, it costs your body the same amount of energy, or more, than if you sprinted the same distance. It's more showing off than actually useful.\"\n\n\nDraco nodded, \"There are some exceptions, like not using a ladder.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Sure. Now, I have a theory\u2026 Instead of pulling yourself apart and reassembling at a new location, by a predefined spell that basically kills you for a moment or two, you disperse the entire world, and move it till you are aligned with your preferred location, and reassemble.\"\n\n\nDraco stared, \"That's\u2026 Insane. I understand you could avoid ending up inside something, because you are an active participant. You can see what's about to happen\u2026 But the raw energy required to disperse the entire universe? That's huge. Secondly, what would the effect be on weather systems, animal patterns, planetary orbits? You could make the entire universe begin to implode!\"\n\n\nKyle grinned, \"Yep. That's where I went to, as well. But then I thought, we don't actually need to pull the entire universe apart. You simply need to pull apart two locations, and draw a line between them, and traverse the line. It's effectively dropping into a higher plane of existence, so that distance can be compressed.\"\n\n\nDraco scratched his chin, \"An Einstein-Rosen bridge. A wormhole\u2026 Wasn't there some research that said that wouldn't work?\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"There is some stuff from the ancient world. Some maths that said that if you had the holes occur in the same universe, then it will collapse before even light could travel from one side to the other. So I have three holes, one in the middle, in another universe.\"\n\n\nDraco cringed, \"That's asking for trouble. Seriously.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Best I've got.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster frowned and used his tail to scribble in the stonework beneath his feet, \"Actually\u2026 The problem is the wormhole would blast its massive energy into the surroundings, right?\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"Yeah, unless stabilised by having part of the bridge go through curved space. Dissipate locally in differing regions.\"\n\n\nDraco nodded, \"Another option would be a closed timelike curve\u2026 You only have two holes, the entry and the exit, but the tunnel between them travels to the past and back to the future, syncing at both ends of the tunnel.\"\n\n\nKyle blinked, \"That would conserve the energy, without blowing the world around to pieces.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster shrugged, \"It's only theory\u2026 Something like this would be ground-breaking, but crazy dangerous.\"\n\n\nKyle burst out laughing, \"Have you met me, yet?\"\n\n\nDraco rolled his eyes, \"Some risks are not worth taking.\"\n\n\nThe Necromancer nodded, \"Some are\u2026 And this would give me an advantage against any of my myriad enemies.\"\n\n\n\"It might make an arm's race.\" Draco warned, \"That would be far worse. That'll lead to everyone stockpiling weapons, each of which could destroy the entire world. That is a tense, dangerous situation where nothing makes sense anymore.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"I know\u2026 But there's only one way I can get through to Fi. By talking to her.\"\n\n\nDraco shrugged, \"So\u2026 Where are you possibly going to get enough energy to make this sort of thing?\"\n\n\nKyle grinned, \"Where I get all the magic for my crazy stuff, now. Necromancy requires intense magic levels. Magic is energy, and potential energy can be converted into magic\u2026 So I rip a hole open to the moment before the universe implodes, and nick it.\"\n\n\nDraco blinked, \"Wow\u2026 Probably screw the chances of the next universe over\u2026 But shouldn't affect us too badly, though that sort of thing tends to ripple backwards.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"Let's just say it involves some deals with the people from the Other Side.\"\n\n\nThe ex-Headmaster lost all sense of humour, \"How much do you owe them?\"\n\n\n\"Nothing, yet.\" Kyle said softly and sighed, \"In the long run? My soul.\"\n\n\nDraco stared at him, \"Life was not worth giving up your soul.\"\n\n\n\"I didn't come back for me.\" Kyle said and shook his head, \"I came back for Fi and Abigail. Those two. No one else.\"\n\n\nDraco paused, looking at the young student and shook his head sadly, \"You are loyal, I will give you that\u2026 But none of this is worth it, Kyle.\"\n\n\nThe student shrugged, \"I know\u2026 Now\u2026 Let's make some new magic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona leaned on her knees, gasping for air.\n\n\nThe elf standing in front of the impenetrable grove of trees looked at her in disgust, \"What are these creatures accompanying you, Princess Applesilver?\"\n\n\nShe stood up slowly, \"What remains of what guarded the School of History and Magic, before it was attacked.\"\n\n\nThe elf paused, \"Your father succeeded?\"\n\n\nFiona's ears leant backwards, \"Open the gates. I am here on behalf all elves.\"\n\n\nThe guard shook his head, \"I cannot allow your guards to pass.\"\n\n\n\"I am your Queen!\" Fiona roared, the earth shaking with her anger, and her eyes flashed white, \"Open the gates.\"\n\n\nHe stared at her in horror, \"The King is dead?\"\n\n\n\"Long live the Queen.\" She growled, and clenched a fist, \"Do you want me to open the gates for you?\"",

That being said, the prophecy that she would need it to save Kyle, Fiona or herself\u2026 He was disturbed by how strong that had been.

A shiver went through him, and he swallowed, \"Madame?\"  The room filled with fog, and a female voice laughed all around him, and he cringed.  \"I have no qualm with you. I seek nothing but shelter, and will continue on my way.\" Duke spoke firmly, tensing.  Two hands grabbed his head as a skeleton screamed in his face, \"Give me back my son!\"  Duke stumbled as it was gone, and the fog faded, leaving him seemingly alone.  He sighed and intoned quietly, the room vibrating dangerously, \"Wake tenebris anima , nympha, et atteritis me gratis!\"  There was a soft popping sound, and two individuals appeared.  One was as old as time, a female skeleton, still wearing that tattered clothes of her last life, her fists clenched, as she glared at the other newcomer, shaking with power.  The other looked from the skeleton to Duke and back, truly terrified.  Abigail swallowed nervously, \"What the crap, professor?\"  Duke winced, clenching his fists, \"You destroyed her son's soul.\"  The skeleton let out a roar of rage and the contents of the cave slammed towards Abigail in a moment of complete chaos, as the rules that governed the planes of existence that he could see swerved, pulled by the sheer force of magic.  Yet, as the magic slammed towards the nymph, her eyes sharpened, and she rolled to the side. She reached into the void of magic heading towards her, and lit a tiny spark.  The spark immediately flowed across the magic, lighting up a fire Ventusamancy, and the room turned slowly, protecting its mother.  Abigail stood up, dusting herself off, and she looked to the Soul Madame, and winced, \"I am truly sorry. But now, I'm leaving.\"  Duke closed his eyes, reaching out to Abigail, and seized the both of them, ripping them apart till they were nothing but atoms.

Secondly, it costs your body the same amount of energy, or more, than if you sprinted the same distance. It's more showing off than actually useful.\"  Draco nodded, \"There are some exceptions, like not using a ladder.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Sure. Now, I have a theory\u2026 Instead of pulling yourself apart and reassembling at a new location, by a predefined spell that basically kills you for a moment or two, you disperse the entire world, and move it till you are aligned with your preferred location, and reassemble.\"  Draco stared, \"That's\u2026 Insane. I understand you could avoid ending up inside something, because you are an active participant. You can see what's about to happen\u2026 But the raw energy required to disperse the entire universe? That's huge. Secondly, what would the effect be on weather systems, animal patterns, planetary orbits? You could make the entire universe begin to implode!\"  Kyle grinned, \"Yep. That's where I went to, as well. But then I thought, we don't actually need to pull the entire universe apart. You simply need to pull apart two locations, and draw a line between them, and traverse the line. It's effectively dropping into a higher plane of existence, so that distance can be compressed.\"  Draco scratched his chin, \"An Einstein-Rosen bridge. A wormhole\u2026 Wasn't there some research that said that wouldn't work?\"  Kyle frowned, \"There is some stuff from the ancient world. Some maths that said that if you had the holes occur in the same universe, then it will collapse before even light could travel from one side to the other. So I have three holes, one in the middle, in another universe.\"  Draco cringed, \"That's asking for trouble. Seriously.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Best I've got.\"  The Headmaster frowned and used his tail to scribble in the stonework beneath his feet, \"Actually\u2026 The problem is the wormhole would blast its massive energy into the surroundings, right?\"  Kyle nodded, \"Yeah, unless stabilised by having part of the bridge go through curved space. Dissipate locally in differing regions.\"  Draco nodded, \"Another option would be a closed timelike curve\u2026 You only have two holes, the entry and the exit, but the tunnel between them travels to the past and back to the future, syncing at both ends of the tunnel.\"  Kyle blinked, \"That would conserve the energy, without blowing the world around to pieces.\"  The Headmaster shrugged, \"It's only theory\u2026 Something like this would be ground-breaking, but crazy dangerous.\"  Kyle burst out laughing, \"Have you met me, yet?\"  Draco rolled his eyes, \"Some risks are not worth taking.\"  The Necromancer nodded, \"Some are\u2026 And this would give me an advantage against any of my myriad enemies.\"  \"It might make an arm's race.\" Draco warned, \"That would be far worse. That'll lead to everyone stockpiling weapons, each of which could destroy the entire world. That is a tense, dangerous situation where nothing makes sense anymore.\"  Kyle nodded, \"I know\u2026 But there's only one way I can get through to Fi. By talking to her.\"  Draco shrugged, \"So\u2026 Where are you possibly going to get enough energy to make this sort of thing?\"  Kyle grinned, \"Where I get all the magic for my crazy stuff, now. Necromancy requires intense magic levels. Magic is energy, and potential energy can be converted into magic\u2026 So I rip a hole open to the moment before the universe implodes, and nick it.\"  Draco blinked, \"Wow\u2026 Probably screw the chances of the next universe over\u2026 But shouldn't affect us too badly, though that sort of thing tends to ripple backwards.\"  Kyle winced, \"Let's just say it involves some deals with the people from the Other Side.\"  The ex-Headmaster lost all sense of humour, \"How much do you owe them?\"  \"Nothing, yet.\" Kyle said softly and sighed, \"In the long run? My soul.\"  Draco stared at him, \"Life was not worth giving up your soul.\"  \"I didn't come back for me.\" Kyle said and shook his head, \"I came back for Fi and Abigail. Those two. No one else.\"  Draco paused, looking at the young student and shook his head sadly, \"You are loyal, I will give you that\u2026 But none of this is worth it, Kyle.\"  The student shrugged, \"I know\u2026 Now\u2026 Let's make some new magic.\"    Fiona leaned on her knees, gasping for air.  The elf standing in front of the impenetrable grove of trees looked at her in disgust, \"What are these creatures accompanying you, Princess Applesilver?\"  She stood up slowly, \"What remains of what guarded the School of History and Magic, before it was attacked.\"  The elf paused, \"Your father succeeded?\"  Fiona's ears leant backwards, \"Open the gates. I am here on behalf all elves.\"  The guard shook his head, \"I cannot allow your guards to pass.\"  \"I am your Queen!\" Fiona roared, the earth shaking with her anger, and her eyes flashed white, \"Open the gates.\"  He stared at her in horror, \"The King is dead?\"  \"Long live the Queen.\" She growled, and clenched a fist, \"Do you want me to open the gates for you?\"",

I will fight beside him.\"\n\n\nShe paused as she saw the slope dropping downwards, caught off-guard by the College's magic.\n\n\nBehind her lay icy fields as far as the eye could see, and in front, in this small valley where the College sat in its lake, lay green grass, buzzing with insects.\n\n\nShe frowned, \"How did they do it, do you think?\"\n\n\nThe professor paused, \"Do what, dear?\"\n\n\nCandice shrugged, \"This. Brought the ground to life.\"\n\n\nBrioni smiled softly, \"It was difficult. A mix of Vitamancy, Ventusamancy and Aimimancy. What you see is the result of a hundred years of enchantment.\"\n\n\nCandice glanced at the professor, \"What do you mean, a hundred years?\"\n\n\nBrioni smiled, \"The true magic isn't that they brought the valley to life, because to begin with, they didn't. It's an ongoing spell. Slowly transforming the world in all directions... The same spell was cast at every school of magic the Founders could find... Eventually, it should give the world a second chance.\"\n\n\nCandice thought for a moment, \"How could such good come from such evil?\"\n\n\n\"Evil?\" The professor asked, startled.\n\n\nCandice sneered, flames again igniting at the ends of every hair on her body, \"Aimimancy. Blood magic.\"\n\n\nBrioni sighed heavily, \"Nothing wrong with Aimimancy, girl... What do you think keeps your circulatory system running?\"\n\n\nCandice stared, \"... My heart?\"\n\n\nBrioni shook her head, \"Maybe before the ice destroyed the world... But magic is how humanity survived.\"\n\n\nCandice cringed, \"I'm an Aimimancer?\"\n\n\n\"No.\" Brioni shook her head, \"Aimimancer's can control their magic. With you, it just happens.\"\n\n\nCandice made a look of disgust, and then winced, \"The world is never simple, is it?\"\n\n\nBrioni smiled sadly at the young Pyromancy, \"No\u2026 I'm afraid it is not.\"\n\n\n\"Let's go find Kyle bloody Kilroy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona glanced up from the map as a castle servant sprinted into the room, a young female elf, dressed in the traditional green of a housecarl, \"Yes?\"\n\n\nThe girl curtsied quickly, \"Milady, we have a disturbance outside the gates.\"\n\n\nFiona sighed heavily, \"Soldiers? Vampires?\"\n\n\n\"Magic, milady. Professor Ilgun asked me to get you. It is not something he has seen, nor understands.\" The housecarl spoke quickly, clearly terrified that she was talking to the queen.\n\n\nFiona's face went white, \"Our magical history professor has no idea?\"\n\n\n\"He has one.\" The housecarl swallowed, \"He said that it was impossible, and I must fetch\u2026 Your majesty.\"\n\n\nFiona rolled her eyes and straightened, her metallic armour creaking, and she followed the housecarl out into the courtyard, where her army was training, and her stone guardians had gone still.\n\n\nShe was uncertain if they had become completely inactive, or were simply waiting.\n\n\nOutside the courtyard, down the long road, and to the city gate she walked, a series of elven guards forming up behind her with a wave of her hand.\n\n\nShe arrived at the gate, and had no need to ask what the problem was.\n\n\nThere was a swirling hole outside the gate, a whirlpool formed on land, out of nothing. It descended out of sight.\n\n\nFiona glanced over at the nearby frantic professor as he scribbled in the sand continually, crossing out calculations and rewriting.\n\n\n\"Necromancy, professor?\"\n\n\nIlgun glanced over at her, \"Madness my queen! Pure and utter madness! If his calculations are wrong, then this man will have killed us all!\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, \"Okay\u2026 Professor, what the hell is that thing?\"\n\n\nIlgun sighed heavily and pointed over at a section of strange calculations, \"It is a\u2026 Gateway, for lack of a more scientific term. It takes two points within our universe, and cuts a hole between them, allowing you to travel quickly, and certainly.\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, \"So\u2026 Kinda like a\u2026 Portal.\"\n\n\nIlgun smiled weakly, \"Yes. Like a portal\u2026 Except, portals generate particles. Physics still dictates laws in this universe, and one of those, is the sort of particles that\u2026 When they collide with others, cancel each other out, releasing a large amount of store energy in a repeatable fashion.\"\n\n\nFiona scratched her head, \"So\u2026 Sort of like a nuclear blast?\"\n\n\n\"Worse!\" The professor yelled, clearly frustrated, and he winced, remembering his position, \"My queen\u2026 This portal, on closing, or opening, may release radiation capable of collapsing our entire universe. In fact, that is the most likely outcome.\"\n\n\nFiona's face went white, \"What?\"\n\n\nThe professor shrugged, \"It's insane. I've been attempting to work out from what location the portal has arrived, and I am all but certain that it comes from the College of History and Magic.\"\n\n\nFiona clenched a fist, her face reddening as her anger lit up, \"Kyle is risking killing us all.\"\n\n\nThen the world turned to dust.\n\n\nEverything seemed to shake, the ground suddenly shifting beneath her in every direction, whilst dust and sand surrounded the air, making it impossible to breathe.\n\n\nShe heard Ilgun growl angrily, and felt rather than saw his spell backfire.\n\n\nFiona herself didn't attempt to clear the air.\n\n\nThough it looked like dust and sand, she didn't get the same feeling about it - it was exempt from normal Terramancy.\n\n\nAnother voice however, a deep and powerful one, full of confidence, rang out, \"Firma terram, aperire aerem, firma terram, aperire aerem!\"\n\n\nEverything stopped.\n\n\nThe dust slammed into the ground, which immediately stopped moving.\n\n\nFiona stared at the man standing where a magical anomaly had been, and she forced herself to her feet, glaring, \"What in the Shadowlands were you thinking?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, glanced at the gates and frowned, \"You going to order these opened?\"\n\n\nFiona drew her sword, and she heard her soldiers following suit as they regained their feet, \"No!\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Suit yourself.\"\n\n\nFiona's eyes bulged as the gates swung open and Kyle walked through unimpeded, and she stared, \"That\u2026 That was\u2026 Enchanted.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"Yep. Designed to make sure that the entire Elvish Kingdom would go on alert if someone other than the gatekeeper or royalty opened the gate. Also meant to unleash something to do with fire and growing trees. Not quite sure how that would actually work.\"\n\n\nFiona pointed her sword, \"Seize that man. This is an invasion.\"\n\n\nKyle rolled his eyes, \"Seriously, Fi? I'm not your enemy. If I was, you and every elf would be dead already.\" He snapped his fingers and every weapon in sight turned to sand, including the one in her hand.\n\n\nShe clenched a fist, pushing out her magic, trying to seize the sand and reform it into a new weapon.\n\n\nThe sand didn't react.\n\n\nFiona glanced at it and back up at Kyle, who smiled awkwardly, and she had a flash of the powerful, and utterly socially inept student she had met just a short time ago.\n\n\nShe clenched her fists, \"You've doomed us, Kyle. Declaring war on the Shadowlands?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Fi\u2026 It isn't about me. I'm not doing that for revenge or anything.\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, watching him carefully, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\"There is a vampire attack planned. To destroy this city.\" Kyle shrugged, \"How else did they get such a massive force of vampires to attack the College in so short a time? Vampires were the first to arrive to attack the College. They're the furthest away, and should have heard about it last.\"\n\n\nFiona shrugged, \"No one has crossed the border.\"\n\n\nThe young necromancer rolled his eyes, \"Border? That means you have a border guard. Who would be dead.\"\n\n\nFiona laughed, \"We enchanted our land's borders. We know if anything dead comes here.\"\n\n\n\"Did it trigger for me?\" Kyle asked, smiling innocently, and Fiona winced, \"You're not dead.\"\n\n\n\"I died Fi!\" Kyle yelled angrily, dust around them vibrating with his anger, the air becoming solid for a moment. Kyle shook his head, \"Your enchantments detect if someone has the signature of the Other Side. I do. Your enchantments are broken. They broke when your father died.\"\n\n\nThe last sentence rang something inside her mind.\n\n\nFiona swallowed, \"Betrayal?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\" Kyle growled and he shook his head, \"The Elvish Kingdom is undefended, especially against an attack of this size.\"\n\n\nA soldier stepped forward, \"You know nothing of the Elvish people! You address our queen by a pet name!\"\n\n\nKyle glared at him, \"Son, step back. Adults are talking.\"\n\n\nThe soldier yelled and punched, and Fiona winced as the soldier vanished, pulled apart atom by atom.\n\n\nFiona winced, \"Tell me you didn\u2019t kill him.\"\n\n\n\"No I didn't, queen.\" Kyle said sarcastically, and Fiona shrugged, \"Did you hear me complaining?\"\n\n\n\"No, my queen.\" Kyle smiled.\n\n\nFiona sighed, \"Please, I'm sorry, okay? I am. I just thought\u2026 You were a danger.\"\n\n\n\"I am.\" Kyle said sadly and shrugged, \"I just invented a new magic that could have blown the universe apart. Even needed some help making it.\"\n\n\nFiona's face drained of colour, \"Ilgun wasn't wrong? You could have killed us all?\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"I need you, Fi. I'm sorry\u2026 Wait, did you say Ilgun?\"\n\n\nThe professor raised a hand nearby, \"I am Professor Ilgun\u2026 Necromancer.\"\n\n\nKyle grinned, \"Awesome. Totally a fan\u2026 Though, your theories on cross-dimensional travel are a load of crap. Seriously.\"\n\n\nIlgun blinked, \"Excuse me?\"\n\n\nKyle sighed and shifted his hand, clearing an area of sand and then a series of eight equations appeared, \"These are accurate, having actually succeeded.\"\n\n\nIlgun glanced at them and then back up, \"No. You're wrong.\"\n\n\nFiona burst out laughing, \"Professor, you're talking to a Necromancer. He's died and come back, and manage to create a portal. Seriously.\"\n\n\n\"He was wrong!\" The professor growled, and then swallowed, \"My queen\u2026 This\u2026 Necromancer\u2026 Only arrived several hours after beginning his travel. It was not instantaneous, his equations are wrong.\"\n\n\n\"It's to allow for the exotic particles to dissipate without ripping the universe a new singularity.\" Kyle said with a smile, \"It's intentional.\"\n\n\nIlgun paused and Kyle smiled at her, \"Your soldier is on the roof behind you. Sort of precarious, but I didn't kill him.\"\n\n\nShe glanced up and laughed as she saw the soldier balancing on a pole on top of a roof, and turned back, \"Right. So, Kyle\u2026 What the hell is going on?\"\n\n\nHe sighed heavily, \"I\u2026 This comes down to you and Abigail.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked in surprise, \"It isn't about you?\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"Who on earth would care about an Aimimancer?\"\n\n\nShe looked at him, \"You became a Necromancer.\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"Incidental. Doesn't matter.\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\nKyle rubbed his face, \"Back when we had your dad's army on the College's doorstep, when an elvish spear killed me? It couldn't kill me because I bound my lifeforce, so I could protect you and Abigail. It was all about you two. Unfortunately, I got stuck between worlds. A ghost\u2026 I finally managed to work out how to cross over into the Other Side, and some people there taught me how to come back\u2026 For you and Abigail.\"\n\n\nFiona felt tears welling in her eyes, \"All this? For me?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"You're worth it\u2026 However, all this has set off the crapstorm that was the world's political situation. Now\u2026 Everyone wants a piece of each other. I'm just trying to keep up.\"\n\n\nFiona smiled, \"You're sweet.\"\n\n\n\"My three human generals were assassinated by an elf, a pixie, and something else.\"\n\n\nThat ruined the mood. Fiona's eyes widened, \"The Bloodbound.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"They'll want your head next.\"\n\n\nFiona swallowed, \"My family exterminated the Pact.\"\n\n\nHe shrugged again, \"Then they're back. People can sometimes go back to old ways. There's revivals. Nothing like people coming back from the dead to inspire faith.\"\n\n\nShe ran a hand through her hair, \"We're screwed.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"I'm here now, Fi. For you.\"\n\n\nShe blinked, \"You think you can do something?\"\n\n\nHe winced, \"I need a day to recharge from the wormhole\u2026 That wasn't easy. Also, I turn to stone during the day, and sunrise ain't far away. But, tomorrow night, I can create an enchantment that will slave the will of anything unliving inside your borders, to you.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, \"Wow. Really? And that would help?\"\n\n\n\"Vampire body guards.\" Kyle said and smiled, \"Could you ask for anything faster?\"\n\n\nShe smiled and nodded, \"Awesome\u2026 So, I have to keep you safe, in a Kingdom that hates your guts, whilst a renegade group wants to kill the both of us.\"\n\n\n\"Just one day. Like twelve hours. Maybe thirteen.\" Kyle smiled sheepishly.\n\n\nFiona shrugged, \"We've faced off against worse.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail shivered by the shoreline, hugging her arms to herself as she felt her breathing slow.\n\n\nProfessor Duke had fallen into some sort of hibernation, and she felt the same happening to herself.\n\n\nThe world was just too cold.\n\n\nShe blinked, her vision going hazing, but the world tipped sideways.\n\n\nAbigail stared at the image, too cold and tired to move. Where had the exhaustion sprung up from?\n\n\nOh, she had fallen over. That's why the world had tipped over.\n\n\nThe wind in her ears became a high pitched song of static, and understanding began to dawn as her eyes fluttered shut, too tired to keep open.\n\n\nI'm freezing to death.\n\n\nAbigail begged her body to move, to let go, to open her eyes.\n\n\nAnything.\n\n\nThere was a dull wump of sound, and she felt a burning sensation touch her cheek.\n\n\nHer eyes fluttered again, revealing a blurry figure, \"Kyle?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBellum looked at the bedraggled four lying in the remains of the infirmary, a young human mage dancing over them, and he sighed heavily, \"What is their condition?\"\n\n\nThe mage laughed tightly, \"Just a spot of pneumonia. Nothing I haven't seen before.\"\n\n\nBellum glared, \"I know that. Why the concern, then?\"\n\n\nThe mage winced, \"Sorry. Used to superiors who only want to hear one thing...\"\n\n\nHe waved a hand to Professor Gallagher and the Silvergate girl, \"These two are fine. They'll be right as rain in the morning...\"\n\n\nHe trailed off as he glanced at the other two, \"... I... I've only worked on a dryad once before. It didn't end well... As to the nymph, I have no idea why she is breathing. Her heart stopped hours ago.\"\n\n\nBellum's eyes widened slightly, \"Abigail hasn't died... I hope Kyle had a hand in it.\"\n\n\nThere was a sound of branches popping and creaking as Professor Duke raised his head, \"I'm afraid not. Her secret manifested again... And if you wish this school to remain hospitable... I see only one solution. Leave her to the wastes.\"\n\n\nBellum clenched his fists, his tail cracking the air, \"What do you mean, Adrian?\"\n\n\nThe necromancer sighed heavily, \"I have tried to seek a solution, but I have not found one. Young Miss Ignis carries a secret, and it will turn our world to ice. I will not reveal it - the secret is hers... But I see no way to contain her. So let her be frozen to solid ice.\"\n\n\nBellum shook his head, \"No.\"\n\n\nDuke stood up, \"We have no choice, Draco!\"\n\n\n\"Neither do I.\" He shrugged, \"Kyle loves the nymph. I am bound to Kyle.\"\n\n\nDuke laughed, \"He intentionally made sure you were unbound, so you could make decisions like this.\"\n\n\nThe young mage raised a hand, \"Um... Sorry to interrupt, but how exactly is the nymph keeping alive?\"\n\n\nDuke glanced from the mage and then to the student, shocked, \"I... Uh... Bellum?\"\n\n\nThe half-dragon nodded slowly, \"I see it. A wooden disc in her hand, the magical prevention seal that Kyle made... How would it keep her alive?\"\n\n\nDuke crouched, staring, \"She's siphoning off the Aimimancy from it. Draining its power for herself...\"\n\n\nBellum scratched his head, \"I thought Silvergate saved them... Kyle is in the Elvish Kingdom.\"\n\n\nDuke shrugged, \"How could a Vitamancer learn Aimimancy so easily? It's not exactly an easy magic... Let alone for someone who feels... Everything.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail was in a dark room.\n\n\nIt was like a corridor, made from wood, with a thatch ceiling.\n\n\nA house.\n\n\nShe could hear a rush of wind, and glancing out a window terrified her.\n\n\nThousands of vampires swarmed out there, all devouring everyone in sight.\n\n\nBreaking down houses as if they were made of leaves.\n\n\nAbigail crouched, trying to stay hidden.\n\n\nShe felt lost, as if she wasn't meant to be where she was.\n\n\nIt just felt... Wrong.\n\n\nShe crept down the hallway, looking for a place to hide, when she heard an impetuous young voice, that of a child, \"But why do we have to hide? Why can't we fight back?\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, knowing you can't fight that many vampires. Not when one alone could destroy the whole village.\n\n\nShe heard the caring voice of a woman, \"Because we can't fight back, Kyle. Maybe one day when you're all grown up, you can go to the College of Magic and History, and convince Headmaster Draco to come save us... By today, we hide.\"\n\n\nAbigail felt her heart beating and peeked around the corner, seeing three people hiding underneath a table.\n\n\nThe man was in his thirties, and had an unsheathed sword in one hand, and his other arm crept around his son's shoulders, and gripped his wife's hand in a white knuckle embrace.\n\n\nThe woman's hair was dead white, her eyes a brilliant blue, her skin was white, flecked with red...\n\n\nAbigail blinked.\n\n\nThe woman was a fire nymph!\n\n\nAnd then there was the son... And her eyes welled with tears, there was no mistaking that stubborn jaw, or those intense eyes.\n\n\nIt was... Kyle.\n\n\nHer heart skipped a beat.\n\n\nThen she heard a growl, the wall was torn apart.\n\n\nA vampire stood there, a gangly creature, that few could mistake for a man. It's face was covered in blood, fresh rivulets ran down its cheeks. Its skin was as black as the night it came from, and its eyes were heartless, glowing red.\n\n\nKyle's father leapt towards it, his sword stabbing hard, but the vampire simply caught the sword and crumpled the metal in its class, before knocking the man back with a blow that ripped him from pelvis to throat.\n\n\nKyle's father collapsed dying from the off-hand movement, and then the vampire's eyes locked on Kyle and it stepped forward.\n\n\nAbigail shot in front of them, feeling her magic swell, she screamed angrily, her voice going raw, directing a blast of magic at the vampire, \"No!\"\n\n\nNothing happened.\n\n\nThe vampire streaked through the magic as if it wasn't there, and Abigail fell to her knees, vomiting, as the vampire went through her.\n\n\nShe spun around in horror, realizing she was trapped in a memory, and saw Kyle's mother struggling in the vampires claws.\n\n\nIt laughed, \"I might turn you... Then you can come back and eat your son!\"\n\n\nKyle stumbled and fell as he ran across the floor, grabbing his father's broken sword before running towards the vampire who kicked him aside, \"Easy kid, I ain't done with my meal.\"\n\n\nTears ran freely down her face as Abigail was forced to watch.\n\n\nThe vampire took it's time draining every ounce of blood from Kyle's mother, delicately returning it to her again.\n\n\nThe woman shook, going from a sickly pale to a darker shade, and he stepped back, \"Oh, you are a feisty one! Trying to fight back!\"\n\n\nAbigail glanced over at Kyle in fear, and stared as she saw it.\n\n\nHe was staring at his hand, slick with the blood of his father, and understanding was dawning.\n\n\nKyle muttered quietly, and the blood floated into the air, a small bubble floating in front of his face.\n\n\nThe vampire noticed, and turned, \"A damn Aimimancer?\"\n\n\nIt leapt at him, trying to kill him, but Kyle stretched the blood in the air, and it became a shield, bouncing the vampire back.\n\n\nAbigail smiled sadly, \"Go, Kyle... That's it... Come on...\"\n\n\nThe vampire broke through the barrier, strangling Kyle, lifting him into the air.\n\n\nIt gloated, \"What are you going to do now, little Aimimancer?\"\n\n\nKyle's mother groaned quietly turning, \"Hungry.\"\n\n\nThe vampire laughed, \"Do you want this?\"\n\n\n\"Wants...\" The woman moaned, stumbling towards her son.\n\n\nAbigail cringed, fighting the urge to howl.\n\n\nThen Kyle managed to gasp something, and the vampire recoiled, dropping him as it patted it's arm, putting out a tiny fire, and looked down at him in disgust, \"You are pathetic.\"\n\n\nKyle forced himself to his feet, his throat black with bruising, \"Unleash inferorum lamia, et ossa eorum, et mai.\"\n\n\nThe vampire vanished in a twisted scream of wrenched bones and flame.\n\n\nSo did Kyle's mother, screaming as she went.\n\n\nAbigail cringed as she heard the hundreds of screams from outside.\n\n\nKyle had just vanquished the vampire hoarde... Discovered Aimimancy, and watched his parents torn apart.\n\n\nThis was the reason he was who he was.\n\n\nThis was what had created the hatred born inside him.\n\n\nThe world around her swirled.\n\n\nThe professor's unusually serious face faded and he rubbed his hands together, \"I think we have time for one more thing. We are going to make a charm, which can help you out while you're learning. It will block you from using magic while you are wearing it, and you will be expected to wear it at all times from now on, unless you are instructed to remove it.\"\n\n\nKyle rubbed his temples, a simple object, true enough... But it would hurt like hell for him to wear... But he should have expected it.\n\n\nAbigail smiled as she watched Kyle form the wooden charm, and then the world was wrenched from beneath her feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandice sat up in the bed, groaning and holding her head. She took in the room with a glance.\n\n\nOld masonry stone, etched reliefs, and shattered walls where once ornate windows had hung.\n\n\nThe infirmary at the College of History and Magic.\n\n\nShe pulled the thin sheet aside and stepped down onto the tiled floor, wincing at the cold as it bit.\n\n\nShe ruffled her black hair, and tucked her defining silver strand behind one ear, and then she focused.\n\n\nThe room was quiet, the only sounds coming from a single other occupant - a young nymph, seemingly frozen in place, staring sightlessly at the ceiling.\n\n\nCandice paused, cocking her head.\n\n\nIt was the nymph who had been the friend of Applesilver... A friend of Kyle bloody Kilroy.\n\n\nHer fists formed, and she muttered urgently, a ring of fire springing up around her - she wasn't necessarily in safe hands here.\n\n\n\"Cool your jets.\" Came a commanding voice, and Candice spun, staring.\n\n\nIt hadn't been an etched relief.\n\n\nThe dragon had unfurled it's wings and dropped to the ground, revealing Headmaster Bellum Draco before her, his tail moving anxiously behind him, his eyes burning orange, and staring at her.\n\n\nCandice glared, \"Sorry, I hardly trust a half dragon.\"\n\n\nDraco shrugged, and Candice screamed, clutching her head as her fire was extinguished. She glared up at him, \"How dare you?\"\n\n\nHe laughed, a low soft rumble that sent chills down her spine, and the half-man smiled, \"You are merely a student of Pyromancy, young Silvergate... You are talented, secure, and highly intelligent... Tell me your odds of surviving a fight.\"\n\n\nShe swallowed nervously, \"Nearly none. But enough to run.\"\n\n\nDraco nodded, \"Then be glad you don't have to run today.\"\n\n\nCandice blinked, and then winced as she realized, as Draco glanced down at the prone nymph, \"You're here protecting her. For Kyle...\"\n\n\nDraco nodded, frowning, \"What happened to her?\"\n\n\nCandice stared, \"No idea... Why are you asking me? I had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\nDraco spun, \"You and Professor Gallagher brought her here... Well, you were carrying her, and Professor Duke, but succumbed to hyperthermia a short way from the walls.\"\n\n\nCandice scratched her head, \"Last I remember... I was standing on a hill, overlooking the island. I was coming to help Kilroy.\"\n\n\nDraco cocked his head, reminding her of a snake, \"And why was that?\"\n\n\nCandice shrugged, \"He wants to kill the vampires. Wipe out the Shadowlands. My family has been protecting those borders for generations... The fight is being lost.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster sagged, the fight leaving him, \"I'm sorry, Miss Silvergate.\"\n\n\nCandice froze, fear pumping through her, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\nDraco winced, \"You saw the size of the army the Shadowlands sent here... Would your family have allowed it to pass, unchecked? Or would they have fought?\"\n\n\nShe shook her head, \"They would have known they couldn't stop it... They would have hid...\"\n\n\nDraco shook his head, \"I knew your father, Miss Silvergate. I helped him exterminate the dragons when they attacked ten years ago... He would have fought. Down to the last man, simply to give whatever soul the army was targeting, a chance... And without those efforts we might not have survived at all.\"\n\n\nCandice collapsed onto the edge of a bed, fighting back tears.\n\n\nShe was a Silvergate.\n\n\nThe war came first, mourning second.\n\n\nThe dead can be remembered once their dead outnumbered your own.\n\n\nA tear stubbornly slid down her cheek, and she glanced up at Draco in embarrassment, but the Headmaster was gone.\n\n\nCandice pulled her knees up to her chin.\n\n\nHow could her family be dead?\n\n\nHow could it have happened?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail paused in the hallway, or what little was left of it, and let out a sad sigh.\n\n\nA nearby male voice immediate mimicked her.\n\n\nAbigail spun in surprise, and frowned as she saw a blonde haired man lying casually halfway up the wall. She raised an eyebrow, \"So... You're a ghost?\"\n\n\nHe dropped to the ground, landing with an impact that shook her, and he shrugged, \"Sorta. I'm what happens if you don't manage to resurrect yourself. Like your boyfriend did.\"\n\n\nHer heart fluttered for a moment, and then the danger of the situation kicked in. \"How did I even get here?\"\n\n\nThe ghost laughed, \"Easy, nymph. First things first, my name is Wes Anderson, and I saved your life.\"\n\n\nShe frowned, \"How so?\"\n\n\nHe grinned, \"A sceptic. Awesome... You and that funny wooden guy who died once, the two of you were basically frozen. Dying. So I thought my old buddy Kyle might actually be thankful if I saved the two of you. Saving woody was easy - he's a Necromancer, and has paid the price, so he can't die... You on the other hand...\"\n\n\nAbigail swallowed, \"What did you do to me?\"\n\n\nWes rolled his eyes, \"I'm a ghost, deary. I can't interfere with the living world. Takes me years to even make an object as small as an amulet move. Thankfully, time is a bit weird here.\"\n\n\nAbigail raised an eyebrow, \"Amulet?\"\n\n\nWes grinned, \"Kyle's. His anti-magic charm. Popped it into your hand, and you started sucking the magic out of it. It was one in a million, but you saved yourself.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled weakly, \"Explains the visions... And now... What? I'm stuck?\"\n\n\nWes winced, \"Please don't be this stupid. That's not fun.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"I used Aimimancy, and nearly died... I'm stuck here... Until I become a Necromancer.\"\n\n\nWes clapped his hands, \"Awesome. Yes! You are stuck, and it'll mean Kyle will have to come to your rescue!\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"And you'll steal his body, and become a true Necromancer... By cheating.\"\n\n\nWes winced, \"Whoops. Didn't mean to say that much.\"\n\n\nAbigail felt something swelling inside her, a darkness, a hatred, and a power that blazed brighter than the sun. Words began to spill out of her mouth, forcing themselves out, as her fists clenched, and she felt the fear wash over the idiotic ghost.\n\n\n\"Wes Anderson, you have committed crimes against the Other Side, and your debts are overdue. What do you plead?\" Her voice echoed at a pitch too low for any of her species.\n\n\nWes stared at her, \"You're the Reaper? Seriously?\"\n\n\nShe held out her hand and magic swirled into it, something opposite to Vitamancy.\n\n\nThe ghost started to sweat, \"They say you can't run from a Reaper...\"\n\n\n\"You have admitted your guilt.\" She growled, and thrust forward, the magic engulfing the ghost, and obliterating his soul.\n\n\nAbigail collapsed to the ground crying.\n\n\nWhat in hell's gates was wrong with her?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona sat cross-legged in the round room that served as the courtroom, staring at a figure made of stone.\n\n\nKyle...\n\n\nHe sacrificed so much for her, and for everyone else... Simply to improve the political mood he had cursed himself.\n\n\nTo save her... He had walked through Death, and managed to do what one or two other people in the history of magic had managed to do. Invented Necromancy...\n\n\nIt was... Totally him.\n\n\nHe had never done things by half, and when she had run further than he could, he'd found a new way to get to her.\n\n\nThere was a popping sound, and she launched to her feet, drawing a short sword, and blinked as she saw Kyle standing beside the statue that was himself.\n\n\nHe grinned over at her, \"Hey, Fi.\"\n\n\nShe glared, \"Prove it.\"\n\n\nKyle rolled his eyes, \"I'm a crazy ass who could have torn the universe asunder?\"\n\n\nFiona shrugged, \"How are you here and there?\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"Still in the statue. This is a projection. I can't touch anything, and I can't help out with magic... In fact, you're the only one who can see me... So... I get to be an annoying voice in your head...\"\n\n\nShe walked over slowly to him, and then swung her hand around in a world class slap, stumbling as she hit nothing. She smiled, \"Yep, that's you.\"\n\n\nKyle grinned, \"Well then, it's time that the Elven Kingdom got ready, isn't it?\"\n\n\nFiona glared, \"Still say this is all your fault.\"\n\n\n\"It is.\" Kyle said, concern creasing his face, \"No one can justify what I have done. I'm not much more than a...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"... Monster.\" Abigail finished her analysis.\n\n\nHuh! She was trying to actually think something through!\n\n\nSo... The Facts:\n\n\n\n\nStuck in limbo.\n\n\nMaybe even the Limbo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHate making lists.\n\n\nShe killed a ghost.\n\n\nLists barely make sense.\n\n\nShe had a psychotic break earlier thinking she was Death itself.\n\n\nWes called her \na\n Reaper.\n\n\nShe felt completely out of control whenever it happened.\n\n\n\n\nAbigail sighed heavily and leaned back against the brickwork in despair... \n\n\nShe had always known there was darkness in her, every Vitamancer who had ever seen her had gone running for the hills... \n\n\nThat was her secret. \n\n\nShe was cursed... And now... \n\n\nShe was cursed for real. \n\n\nStuck in Limbo.\n\n\nShe sighed heavily, and then blinked as she saw Professor Duke pause in the packed hallway, and turn to face her.\n\n\nHer eyes lit up, \"You can see me?!\"\n\n\nThe Professor walked over slowly through the milling soldiers and crouched, \"How can you be here, Abigail?\"\n\n\nShe winced, \"I... I don't know... I saw Kyle's memories... Then I was here, and there was... A ghost... He said he brought me here. Saved me and trapped me so he could take Kyle on... And then... I...\"\n\n\nDuke frowned, \"The Reaper in you came out and killed Anderson.\"\n\n\nAbigail stared, \"... Yeah.\"\n\n\nDuke nodded slowly, \"Anderson had used this castle as his hiding place from the Reapers... I am deeply sorry that you have seen what hides in you.\"\n\n\nAbigail clenched her fists, bursting into tears, \"What in the Shadowlands is wrong with me?\"\n\n\nDuke shook his head, stroking her cheek, \"It is not anything that is wrong. It is a privilege, an honour, and a hard life that you have been handed... Since the ice cave, you have been awoken. You are a... Reaper...\"\n\n\nAbigail stared at him, \"I... I just lose... Control...\"\n\n\nDuke nodded, \"For now... Abigail, a Reaper hasn't been born in my lifetime. They were only legends, even to me... But, the idea is simple. The Other Side chooses a powerful mage, before they are born, and selects them to be their force in the world. You will right wrongs, reward the righteous, and restore balance between this world and the Other Side.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"So... I'm like... The sword of the Other Side?\"\n\n\nDuke shrugged, \"You also reward and help... But, yes.\"\n\n\nAbigail stood up, \"Take me there.\"\n\n\nDuke frowned, his branches creaking, \"Take you... Where?\"\n\n\n\"The Other Side.\" The nymph growled, her scales flashing red, \"I mean it.\"\n\n\nDuke shook his head, \"I have not been to the Other Side in generations... I would not wish it on anybody.\"\n\n\nAbigail reached out in anger, grabbing Duke's neck, and lifted him off the ground, and her voice echoed, \"Take me there!\"\n\n\nDuke glanced around as the hallway paused, staring, and then he dropped to the ground, Abigail's grip vanishing as she became ghost-like, the shock hitting her.\n\n\nDuke brushed himself down, and then his shoulders bulged, twigs growing out from it, surrounding the both of them in a cocoon.\n\n\nThe Professor sighed, \"You stepped back into the world of the living, just now... The Reaper is passion and purpose. You had both. You controlled it, instead of being controlled by it.\"\n\n\nAbigail crossed her arms, \"I don't care.\"\n\n\nThe professor cocked his head, \"You should... If you learn to control it completely... You would no longer be the will of the Other Side in the world... They would send more Reapers after... You.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"And if you took me there... And they thought I could go rogue... There'd be no coming back.\"\n\n\nDuke nodded slowly.\n\n\nShe sighed heavily, \"Awesome... So now what? You resurrect me?\"\n\n\nDuke shook his head, \"Resurrection of another being for more than a short time is a crime against the Other Side. You would destroy me for it.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"Awesome... How many rules are there to Necromancy?\"\n\n\n\"Millions.\" Duke said carefully, \"Necromancy is not a skill... It comes from negotiating... You promise someone from the Other Side something, and in return, they give you their own magic... The contract is what binds you, and allows you to do what you can.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"... Kyle?\"\n\n\nDuke's face fell, his wooden face revealing pained emotion, in a way Abigail had never thought it could, \"Kyle has promised his soul.\"\n\n\nShe stared, \"Wha... What?\"\n\n\nDuke shrugged, \"To save you and Fiona, Kyle gave up everything that was his to give... There's no competition between you and Fiona for his heart... The Other Side will destroy him if he doesn't pay.\"\n\n\nAbigail swallowed, \"That's... That's why I'm here isn't it... To kill Kyle?\"\n\n\nDuke shook his head, \"You would not kill him. He would become a prisoner... But Kyle has not yet broke his contract.\"\n\n\nAbigail sighed heavily, curling up on the floor of branches, \"So... How do I get back?\"\n\n\nDuke shrugged, \"I am not a Reaper, and you use magic that is beyond that of a Necromancer... A different, more pure magic... It is up to you to find it and bring yourself back. I can advise, but little else.\"\n\n\nAbigail sighed as the branches receded, \"Thank you...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandice stood on the rooftop, looking at the military camps outside the city walls, their fires dotted the landscape. She knew they were there, but still struggled to understand it.\n\n\nNone of that had been there when she had looked down at the city.\n\n\nKyle must have cast a massive illusion to keep all that from sight...\n\n\nShe heard a small pop and spun, staring as she saw Kyle ruffling his hair, and muttering.\n\n\n\"Kilroy.\" She growled, and he turned and rolled his eyes, \"Really do not have the time, Silvergate.\"\n\n\nShe clenched her fists, \"My family is dead because of you!\"\n\n\nKyle vanished with another pop, and Candice glared at the empty space.\n\n\nHow dare he?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle reappeared in the military planning office, \"Bellum!\"\n\n\nThe half dragon glanced up from a map, \"Kyle?\"\n\n\nHe smiled tightly, \"Just a projection. I don't have long. Dwarves are attacking the Elven Kingdom. Tens of thousands. It's four hours till dawn, there.\"\n\n\nBellum cringed, \"Holy mothers... What can we do?\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"Tell Isaac Isaac where I am. Get the trolls coming to us. I hope racial hatred will do the rest... But the trolls are the only ones who can help.\"\n\n\n\"Kilroy!\" Came an angry voice from behind him and Kyle spun, \"Unless you can defeat thirty thousand dwarfish berserkers, I don't give a rat's ass, Silvergate.\"\n\n\nShe trembled with rage, \"There are underground tunnels between the Elvish Kingdom and the Dwarfish Stronghold. They enter into the bank beneath the palace, on the Elvish side.\"\n\n\nKyle paused, \"Holy... Thank you... Any ideas how to stop them?\"\n\n\nSilvergate nodded, \"Hold them off till dawn, and then open another Gateway, back here. Send half this army through.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"It took both Bellum and I to open a portal for one man.\"\n\n\n\"You are not Professor Duke.\" Candice sneered, \"He knows more than you.\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"It takes raw power.\"\n\n\n\"No, it does not.\" Duke said, sliding through a nearby wall, \"I will handle, now, go Kyle.\"\n\n\nHe vanished with a pop.",

            "text": "Brioni looked at her as she crossed a hillside, \"Are you sure?\"  Candice sneered, a ripple of fire passing over her for a moment, \"If Kilroy wants to destroy the vampires... I will fight beside him.\"  She paused as she saw the slope dropping downwards, caught off-guard by the College's magic.  Behind her lay icy fields as far as the eye could see, and in front, in this small valley where the College sat in its lake, lay green grass, buzzing with insects.  She frowned, \"How did they do it, do you think?\"  The professor paused, \"Do what, dear?\"  Candice shrugged, \"This. Brought the ground to life.\"  Brioni smiled softly, \"It was difficult. A mix of Vitamancy, Ventusamancy and Aimimancy. What you see is the result of a hundred years of enchantment.\"  Candice glanced at the professor, \"What do you mean, a hundred years?\"  Brioni smiled, \"The true magic isn't that they brought the valley to life, because to begin with, they didn't. It's an ongoing spell. Slowly transforming the world in all directions... The same spell was cast at every school of magic the Founders could find... Eventually, it should give the world a second chance.\"  Candice thought for a moment, \"How could such good come from such evil?\"  \"Evil?\" The professor asked, startled.  Candice sneered, flames again igniting at the ends of every hair on her body, \"Aimimancy. Blood magic.\"  Brioni sighed heavily, \"Nothing wrong with Aimimancy, girl... What do you think keeps your circulatory system running?\"  Candice stared, \"... My heart?\"  Brioni shook her head, \"Maybe before the ice destroyed the world... But magic is how humanity survived.\"  Candice cringed, \"I'm an Aimimancer?\"  \"No.\" Brioni shook her head, \"Aimimancer's can control their magic. With you, it just happens.\"  Candice made a look of disgust, and then winced, \"The world is never simple, is it?\"  Brioni smiled sadly at the young Pyromancy, \"No\u2026 I'm afraid it is not.\"  \"Let's go find Kyle bloody Kilroy.\"    Fiona glanced up from the map as a castle servant sprinted into the room, a young female elf, dressed in the traditional green of a housecarl, \"Yes?\"  The girl curtsied quickly, \"Milady, we have a disturbance outside the gates.\"  Fiona sighed heavily, \"Soldiers? Vampires?\"  \"Magic, milady. Professor Ilgun asked me to get you. It is not something he has seen, nor understands.\" The housecarl spoke quickly, clearly terrified that she was talking to the queen.  Fiona's face went white, \"Our magical history professor has no idea?\"  \"He has one.\" The housecarl swallowed, \"He said that it was impossible, and I must fetch\u2026 Your majesty.\"  Fiona rolled her eyes and straightened, her metallic armour creaking, and she followed the housecarl out into the courtyard, where her army was training, and her stone guardians had gone still.  She was uncertain if they had become completely inactive, or were simply waiting.  Outside the courtyard, down the long road, and to the city gate she walked, a series of elven guards forming up behind her with a wave of her hand.  She arrived at the gate, and had no need to ask what the problem was.  There was a swirling hole outside the gate, a whirlpool formed on land, out of nothing. It descended out of sight.  Fiona glanced over at the nearby frantic professor as he scribbled in the sand continually, crossing out calculations and rewriting.  \"Necromancy, professor?\"  Ilgun glanced over at her, \"Madness my queen! Pure and utter madness! If his calculations are wrong, then this man will have killed us all!\"  Fiona blinked, \"Okay\u2026 Professor, what the hell is that thing?\"  Ilgun sighed heavily and pointed over at a section of strange calculations, \"It is a\u2026 Gateway, for lack of a more scientific term. It takes two points within our universe, and cuts a hole between them, allowing you to travel quickly, and certainly.\"  Fiona frowned, \"So\u2026 Kinda like a\u2026 Portal.\"  Ilgun smiled weakly, \"Yes. Like a portal\u2026 Except, portals generate particles. Physics still dictates laws in this universe, and one of those, is the sort of particles that\u2026 When they collide with others, cancel each other out, releasing a large amount of store energy in a repeatable fashion.\"  Fiona scratched her head, \"So\u2026 Sort of like a nuclear blast?\"  \"Worse!\" The professor yelled, clearly frustrated, and he winced, remembering his position, \"My queen\u2026 This portal, on closing, or opening, may release radiation capable of collapsing our entire universe. In fact, that is the most likely outcome.\"  Fiona's face went white, \"What?\"  The professor shrugged, \"It's insane. I've been attempting to work out from what location the portal has arrived, and I am all but certain that it comes from the College of History and Magic.\"  Fiona clenched a fist, her face reddening as her anger lit up, \"Kyle is risking killing us all.\"  Then the world turned to dust.  Everything seemed to shake, the ground suddenly shifting beneath her in every direction, whilst dust and sand surrounded the air, making it impossible to breathe.  She heard Ilgun growl angrily, and felt rather than saw his spell backfire.  Fiona herself didn't attempt to clear the air.  Though it looked like dust and sand, she didn't get the same feeling about it - it was exempt from normal Terramancy.  Another voice however, a deep and powerful one, full of confidence, rang out, \"Firma terram, aperire aerem, firma terram, aperire aerem!\"  Everything stopped.  The dust slammed into the ground, which immediately stopped moving.  Fiona stared at the man standing where a magical anomaly had been, and she forced herself to her feet, glaring, \"What in the Shadowlands were you thinking?\"  Kyle shrugged, glanced at the gates and frowned, \"You going to order these opened?\"  Fiona drew her sword, and she heard her soldiers following suit as they regained their feet, \"No!\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Suit yourself.\"  Fiona's eyes bulged as the gates swung open and Kyle walked through unimpeded, and she stared, \"That\u2026 That was\u2026 Enchanted.\"  Kyle nodded, \"Yep. Designed to make sure that the entire Elvish Kingdom would go on alert if someone other than the gatekeeper or royalty opened the gate. Also meant to unleash something to do with fire and growing trees. Not quite sure how that would actually work.\"  Fiona pointed her sword, \"Seize that man. This is an invasion.\"  Kyle rolled his eyes, \"Seriously, Fi? I'm not your enemy. If I was, you and every elf would be dead already.\" He snapped his fingers and every weapon in sight turned to sand, including the one in her hand.  She clenched a fist, pushing out her magic, trying to seize the sand and reform it into a new weapon.  The sand didn't react.  Fiona glanced at it and back up at Kyle, who smiled awkwardly, and she had a flash of the powerful, and utterly socially inept student she had met just a short time ago.  She clenched her fists, \"You've doomed us, Kyle. Declaring war on the Shadowlands?\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Fi\u2026 It isn't about me. I'm not doing that for revenge or anything.\"  Fiona frowned, watching him carefully, \"What do you mean?\"  \"There is a vampire attack planned. To destroy this city.\" Kyle shrugged, \"How else did they get such a massive force of vampires to attack the College in so short a time? Vampires were the first to arrive to attack the College. They're the furthest away, and should have heard about it last.\"  Fiona shrugged, \"No one has crossed the border.\"  The young necromancer rolled his eyes, \"Border? That means you have a border guard. Who would be dead.\"  Fiona laughed, \"We enchanted our land's borders. We know if anything dead comes here.\"  \"Did it trigger for me?\" Kyle asked, smiling innocently, and Fiona winced, \"You're not dead.\"  \"I died Fi!\" Kyle yelled angrily, dust around them vibrating with his anger, the air becoming solid for a moment. Kyle shook his head, \"Your enchantments detect if someone has the signature of the Other Side. I do. Your enchantments are broken. They broke when your father died.\"  The last sentence rang something inside her mind.  Fiona swallowed, \"Betrayal?\"  \"Yes.\" Kyle growled and he shook his head, \"The Elvish Kingdom is undefended, especially against an attack of this size.\"  A soldier stepped forward, \"You know nothing of the Elvish people! You address our queen by a pet name!\"  Kyle glared at him, \"Son, step back. Adults are talking.\"  The soldier yelled and punched, and Fiona winced as the soldier vanished, pulled apart atom by atom.  Fiona winced, \"Tell me you didn\u2019t kill him.\"  \"No I didn't, queen.\" Kyle said sarcastically, and Fiona shrugged, \"Did you hear me complaining?\"  \"No, my queen.\" Kyle smiled.  Fiona sighed, \"Please, I'm sorry, okay? I am. I just thought\u2026 You were a danger.\"  \"I am.\" Kyle said sadly and shrugged, \"I just invented a new magic that could have blown the universe apart. Even needed some help making it.\"  Fiona's face drained of colour, \"Ilgun wasn't wrong? You could have killed us all?\"  Kyle winced, \"I need you, Fi. I'm sorry\u2026 Wait, did you say Ilgun?\"  The professor raised a hand nearby, \"I am Professor Ilgun\u2026 Necromancer.\"  Kyle grinned, \"Awesome. Totally a fan\u2026 Though, your theories on cross-dimensional travel are a load of crap. Seriously.\"  Ilgun blinked, \"Excuse me?\"  Kyle sighed and shifted his hand, clearing an area of sand and then a series of eight equations appeared, \"These are accurate, having actually succeeded.\"  Ilgun glanced at them and then back up, \"No. You're wrong.\"  Fiona burst out laughing, \"Professor, you're talking to a Necromancer. He's died and come back, and manage to create a portal. Seriously.\"  \"He was wrong!\" The professor growled, and then swallowed, \"My queen\u2026 This\u2026 Necromancer\u2026 Only arrived several hours after beginning his travel. It was not instantaneous, his equations are wrong.\"  \"It's to allow for the exotic particles to dissipate without ripping the universe a new singularity.\" Kyle said with a smile, \"It's intentional.\"  Ilgun paused and Kyle smiled at her, \"Your soldier is on the roof behind you. Sort of precarious, but I didn't kill him.\"  She glanced up and laughed as she saw the soldier balancing on a pole on top of a roof, and turned back, \"Right. So, Kyle\u2026 What the hell is going on?\"  He sighed heavily, \"I\u2026 This comes down to you and Abigail.\"  Fiona blinked in surprise, \"It isn't about you?\"  Kyle laughed, \"Who on earth would care about an Aimimancer?\"  She looked at him, \"You became a Necromancer.\"  He shrugged, \"Incidental. Doesn't matter.\"  Fiona frowned, \"I don't understand.\"  Kyle rubbed his face, \"Back when we had your dad's army on the College's doorstep, when an elvish spear killed me? It couldn't kill me because I bound my lifeforce, so I could protect you and Abigail. It was all about you two. Unfortunately, I got stuck between worlds. A ghost\u2026 I finally managed to work out how to cross over into the Other Side, and some people there taught me how to come back\u2026 For you and Abigail.\"  Fiona felt tears welling in her eyes, \"All this? For me?\"  Kyle shrugged, \"You're worth it\u2026 However, all this has set off the crapstorm that was the world's political situation. Now\u2026 Everyone wants a piece of each other. I'm just trying to keep up.\"  Fiona smiled, \"You're sweet.\"  \"My three human generals were assassinated by an elf, a pixie, and something else.\"  That ruined the mood. Fiona's eyes widened, \"The Bloodbound.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"They'll want your head next.\"  Fiona swallowed, \"My family exterminated the Pact.\"  He shrugged again, \"Then they're back. People can sometimes go back to old ways. There's revivals. Nothing like people coming back from the dead to inspire faith.\"  She ran a hand through her hair, \"We're screwed.\"  Kyle laughed, \"I'm here now, Fi. For you.\"  She blinked, \"You think you can do something?\"  He winced, \"I need a day to recharge from the wormhole\u2026 That wasn't easy. Also, I turn to stone during the day, and sunrise ain't far away. But, tomorrow night, I can create an enchantment that will slave the will of anything unliving inside your borders, to you.\"  Fiona blinked, \"Wow. Really? And that would help?\"  \"Vampire body guards.\" Kyle said and smiled, \"Could you ask for anything faster?\"  She smiled and nodded, \"Awesome\u2026 So, I have to keep you safe, in a Kingdom that hates your guts, whilst a renegade group wants to kill the both of us.\"  \"Just one day. Like twelve hours. Maybe thirteen.\" Kyle smiled sheepishly.  Fiona shrugged, \"We've faced off against worse.\"    Abigail shivered by the shoreline, hugging her arms to herself as she felt her breathing slow.  Professor Duke had fallen into some sort of hibernation, and she felt the same happening to herself.  The world was just too cold.  She blinked, her vision going hazing, but the world tipped sideways.  Abigail stared at the image, too cold and tired to move. Where had the exhaustion sprung up from?  Oh, she had fallen over. That's why the world had tipped over.  The wind in her ears became a high pitched song of static, and understanding began to dawn as her eyes fluttered shut, too tired to keep open.  I'm freezing to death.  Abigail begged her body to move, to let go, to open her eyes.  Anything.  There was a dull wump of sound, and she felt a burning sensation touch her cheek.  Her eyes fluttered again, revealing a blurry figure, \"Kyle?\"    Bellum looked at the bedraggled four lying in the remains of the infirmary, a young human mage dancing over them, and he sighed heavily, \"What is their condition?\"  The mage laughed tightly, \"Just a spot of pneumonia. Nothing I haven't seen before.\"  Bellum glared, \"I know that. Why the concern, then?\"  The mage winced, \"Sorry. Used to superiors who only want to hear one thing...\"  He waved a hand to Professor Gallagher and the Silvergate girl, \"These two are fine. They'll be right as rain in the morning...\"  He trailed off as he glanced at the other two, \"... I... I've only worked on a dryad once before. It didn't end well... As to the nymph, I have no idea why she is breathing. Her heart stopped hours ago.\"  Bellum's eyes widened slightly, \"Abigail hasn't died... I hope Kyle had a hand in it.\"  There was a sound of branches popping and creaking as Professor Duke raised his head, \"I'm afraid not. Her secret manifested again... And if you wish this school to remain hospitable... I see only one solution. Leave her to the wastes.\"  Bellum clenched his fists, his tail cracking the air, \"What do you mean, Adrian?\"  The necromancer sighed heavily, \"I have tried to seek a solution, but I have not found one. Young Miss Ignis carries a secret, and it will turn our world to ice. I will not reveal it - the secret is hers... But I see no way to contain her. So let her be frozen to solid ice.\"  Bellum shook his head, \"No.\"  Duke stood up, \"We have no choice, Draco!\"  \"Neither do I.\" He shrugged, \"Kyle loves the nymph. I am bound to Kyle.\"  Duke laughed, \"He intentionally made sure you were unbound, so you could make decisions like this.\"  The young mage raised a hand, \"Um... Sorry to interrupt, but how exactly is the nymph keeping alive?\"  Duke glanced from the mage and then to the student, shocked, \"I... Uh... Bellum?\"  The half-dragon nodded slowly, \"I see it. A wooden disc in her hand, the magical prevention seal that Kyle made... How would it keep her alive?\"  Duke crouched, staring, \"She's siphoning off the Aimimancy from it. Draining its power for herself...\"  Bellum scratched his head, \"I thought Silvergate saved them... Kyle is in the Elvish Kingdom.\"  Duke shrugged, \"How could a Vitamancer learn Aimimancy so easily? It's not exactly an easy magic... Let alone for someone who feels... Everything.\"    Abigail was in a dark room.  It was like a corridor, made from wood, with a thatch ceiling.  A house.  She could hear a rush of wind, and glancing out a window terrified her.  Thousands of vampires swarmed out there, all devouring everyone in sight.  Breaking down houses as if they were made of leaves.  Abigail crouched, trying to stay hidden.  She felt lost, as if she wasn't meant to be where she was.  It just felt... Wrong.  She crept down the hallway, looking for a place to hide, when she heard an impetuous young voice, that of a child, \"But why do we have to hide? Why can't we fight back?\"  Abigail winced, knowing you can't fight that many vampires. Not when one alone could destroy the whole village.  She heard the caring voice of a woman, \"Because we can't fight back, Kyle. Maybe one day when you're all grown up, you can go to the College of Magic and History, and convince Headmaster Draco to come save us... By today, we hide.\"  Abigail felt her heart beating and peeked around the corner, seeing three people hiding underneath a table.  The man was in his thirties, and had an unsheathed sword in one hand, and his other arm crept around his son's shoulders, and gripped his wife's hand in a white knuckle embrace.  The woman's hair was dead white, her eyes a brilliant blue, her skin was white, flecked with red...  Abigail blinked.  The woman was a fire nymph!  And then there was the son... And her eyes welled with tears, there was no mistaking that stubborn jaw, or those intense eyes.  It was... Kyle.  Her heart skipped a beat.  Then she heard a growl, the wall was torn apart.  A vampire stood there, a gangly creature, that few could mistake for a man. It's face was covered in blood, fresh rivulets ran down its cheeks. Its skin was as black as the night it came from, and its eyes were heartless, glowing red.  Kyle's father leapt towards it, his sword stabbing hard, but the vampire simply caught the sword and crumpled the metal in its class, before knocking the man back with a blow that ripped him from pelvis to throat.  Kyle's father collapsed dying from the off-hand movement, and then the vampire's eyes locked on Kyle and it stepped forward.  Abigail shot in front of them, feeling her magic swell, she screamed angrily, her voice going raw, directing a blast of magic at the vampire, \"No!\"  Nothing happened.  The vampire streaked through the magic as if it wasn't there, and Abigail fell to her knees, vomiting, as the vampire went through her.  She spun around in horror, realizing she was trapped in a memory, and saw Kyle's mother struggling in the vampires claws.  It laughed, \"I might turn you... Then you can come back and eat your son!\"  Kyle stumbled and fell as he ran across the floor, grabbing his father's broken sword before running towards the vampire who kicked him aside, \"Easy kid, I ain't done with my meal.\"  Tears ran freely down her face as Abigail was forced to watch.  The vampire took it's time draining every ounce of blood from Kyle's mother, delicately returning it to her again.  The woman shook, going from a sickly pale to a darker shade, and he stepped back, \"Oh, you are a feisty one! Trying to fight back!\"  Abigail glanced over at Kyle in fear, and stared as she saw it.  He was staring at his hand, slick with the blood of his father, and understanding was dawning.  Kyle muttered quietly, and the blood floated into the air, a small bubble floating in front of his face.  The vampire noticed, and turned, \"A damn Aimimancer?\"  It leapt at him, trying to kill him, but Kyle stretched the blood in the air, and it became a shield, bouncing the vampire back.  Abigail smiled sadly, \"Go, Kyle... That's it... Come on...\"  The vampire broke through the barrier, strangling Kyle, lifting him into the air.  It gloated, \"What are you going to do now, little Aimimancer?\"  Kyle's mother groaned quietly turning, \"Hungry.\"  The vampire laughed, \"Do you want this?\"  \"Wants...\" The woman moaned, stumbling towards her son.  Abigail cringed, fighting the urge to howl.  Then Kyle managed to gasp something, and the vampire recoiled, dropping him as it patted it's arm, putting out a tiny fire, and looked down at him in disgust, \"You are pathetic.\"  Kyle forced himself to his feet, his throat black with bruising, \"Unleash inferorum lamia, et ossa eorum, et mai.\"  The vampire vanished in a twisted scream of wrenched bones and flame.  So did Kyle's mother, screaming as she went.  Abigail cringed as she heard the hundreds of screams from outside.  Kyle had just vanquished the vampire hoarde... Discovered Aimimancy, and watched his parents torn apart.  This was the reason he was who he was.  This was what had created the hatred born inside him.  The world around her swirled.  The professor's unusually serious face faded and he rubbed his hands together, \"I think we have time for one more thing. We are going to make a charm, which can help you out while you're learning. It will block you from using magic while you are wearing it, and you will be expected to wear it at all times from now on, unless you are instructed to remove it.\"  Kyle rubbed his temples, a simple object, true enough... But it would hurt like hell for him to wear... But he should have expected it.  Abigail smiled as she watched Kyle form the wooden charm, and then the world was wrenched from beneath her feet.    Candice sat up in the bed, groaning and holding her head. She took in the room with a glance.  Old masonry stone, etched reliefs, and shattered walls where once ornate windows had hung.  The infirmary at the College of History and Magic.  She pulled the thin sheet aside and stepped down onto the tiled floor, wincing at the cold as it bit.  She ruffled her black hair, and tucked her defining silver strand behind one ear, and then she focused.  The room was quiet, the only sounds coming from a single other occupant - a young nymph, seemingly frozen in place, staring sightlessly at the ceiling.  Candice paused, cocking her head.  It was the nymph who had been the friend of Applesilver... A friend of Kyle bloody Kilroy.  Her fists formed, and she muttered urgently, a ring of fire springing up around her - she wasn't necessarily in safe hands here.  \"Cool your jets.\" Came a commanding voice, and Candice spun, staring.  It hadn't been an etched relief.  The dragon had unfurled it's wings and dropped to the ground, revealing Headmaster Bellum Draco before her, his tail moving anxiously behind him, his eyes burning orange, and staring at her.  Candice glared, \"Sorry, I hardly trust a half dragon.\"  Draco shrugged, and Candice screamed, clutching her head as her fire was extinguished. She glared up at him, \"How dare you?\"  He laughed, a low soft rumble that sent chills down her spine, and the half-man smiled, \"You are merely a student of Pyromancy, young Silvergate... You are talented, secure, and highly intelligent... Tell me your odds of surviving a fight.\"  She swallowed nervously, \"Nearly none. But enough to run.\"  Draco nodded, \"Then be glad you don't have to run today.\"  Candice blinked, and then winced as she realized, as Draco glanced down at the prone nymph, \"You're here protecting her. For Kyle...\"  Draco nodded, frowning, \"What happened to her?\"  Candice stared, \"No idea... Why are you asking me? I had nothing to do with it.\"  Draco spun, \"You and Professor Gallagher brought her here... Well, you were carrying her, and Professor Duke, but succumbed to hyperthermia a short way from the walls.\"  Candice scratched her head, \"Last I remember... I was standing on a hill, overlooking the island. I was coming to help Kilroy.\"  Draco cocked his head, reminding her of a snake, \"And why was that?\"  Candice shrugged, \"He wants to kill the vampires. Wipe out the Shadowlands. My family has been protecting those borders for generations... The fight is being lost.\"  The Headmaster sagged, the fight leaving him, \"I'm sorry, Miss Silvergate.\"  Candice froze, fear pumping through her, \"What do you mean?\"  Draco winced, \"You saw the size of the army the Shadowlands sent here... Would your family have allowed it to pass, unchecked? Or would they have fought?\"  She shook her head, \"They would have known they couldn't stop it... They would have hid...\"  Draco shook his head, \"I knew your father, Miss Silvergate. I helped him exterminate the dragons when they attacked ten years ago... He would have fought. Down to the last man, simply to give whatever soul the army was targeting, a chance... And without those efforts we might not have survived at all.\"  Candice collapsed onto the edge of a bed, fighting back tears.  She was a Silvergate.  The war came first, mourning second.  The dead can be remembered once their dead outnumbered your own.  A tear stubbornly slid down her cheek, and she glanced up at Draco in embarrassment, but the Headmaster was gone.  Candice pulled her knees up to her chin.  How could her family be dead?  How could it have happened?    Abigail paused in the hallway, or what little was left of it, and let out a sad sigh.  A nearby male voice immediate mimicked her.  Abigail spun in surprise, and frowned as she saw a blonde haired man lying casually halfway up the wall. She raised an eyebrow, \"So... You're a ghost?\"  He dropped to the ground, landing with an impact that shook her, and he shrugged, \"Sorta. I'm what happens if you don't manage to resurrect yourself. Like your boyfriend did.\"  Her heart fluttered for a moment, and then the danger of the situation kicked in. \"How did I even get here?\"  The ghost laughed, \"Easy, nymph. First things first, my name is Wes Anderson, and I saved your life.\"  She frowned, \"How so?\"  He grinned, \"A sceptic. Awesome... You and that funny wooden guy who died once, the two of you were basically frozen. Dying. So I thought my old buddy Kyle might actually be thankful if I saved the two of you. Saving woody was easy - he's a Necromancer, and has paid the price, so he can't die... You on the other hand...\"  Abigail swallowed, \"What did you do to me?\"  Wes rolled his eyes, \"I'm a ghost, deary. I can't interfere with the living world. Takes me years to even make an object as small as an amulet move. Thankfully, time is a bit weird here.\"  Abigail raised an eyebrow, \"Amulet?\"  Wes grinned, \"Kyle's. His anti-magic charm. Popped it into your hand, and you started sucking the magic out of it. It was one in a million, but you saved yourself.\"  Abigail smiled weakly, \"Explains the visions... And now... What? I'm stuck?\"  Wes winced, \"Please don't be this stupid. That's not fun.\"  Abigail winced, \"I used Aimimancy, and nearly died... I'm stuck here... Until I become a Necromancer.\"  Wes clapped his hands, \"Awesome. Yes! You are stuck, and it'll mean Kyle will have to come to your rescue!\"  Abigail winced, \"And you'll steal his body, and become a true Necromancer... By cheating.\"  Wes winced, \"Whoops. Didn't mean to say that much.\"  Abigail felt something swelling inside her, a darkness, a hatred, and a power that blazed brighter than the sun. Words began to spill out of her mouth, forcing themselves out, as her fists clenched, and she felt the fear wash over the idiotic ghost.  \"Wes Anderson, you have committed crimes against the Other Side, and your debts are overdue. What do you plead?\" Her voice echoed at a pitch too low for any of her species.  Wes stared at her, \"You're the Reaper? Seriously?\"  She held out her hand and magic swirled into it, something opposite to Vitamancy.  The ghost started to sweat, \"They say you can't run from a Reaper...\"  \"You have admitted your guilt.\" She growled, and thrust forward, the magic engulfing the ghost, and obliterating his soul.  Abigail collapsed to the ground crying.  What in hell's gates was wrong with her?    Fiona sat cross-legged in the round room that served as the courtroom, staring at a figure made of stone.  Kyle...  He sacrificed so much for her, and for everyone else... Simply to improve the political mood he had cursed himself.  To save her... He had walked through Death, and managed to do what one or two other people in the history of magic had managed to do. Invented Necromancy...  It was... Totally him.  He had never done things by half, and when she had run further than he could, he'd found a new way to get to her.  There was a popping sound, and she launched to her feet, drawing a short sword, and blinked as she saw Kyle standing beside the statue that was himself.  He grinned over at her, \"Hey, Fi.\"  She glared, \"Prove it.\"  Kyle rolled his eyes, \"I'm a crazy ass who could have torn the universe asunder?\"  Fiona shrugged, \"How are you here and there?\"  Kyle shook his head, \"Still in the statue. This is a projection. I can't touch anything, and I can't help out with magic... In fact, you're the only one who can see me... So... I get to be an annoying voice in your head...\"  She walked over slowly to him, and then swung her hand around in a world class slap, stumbling as she hit nothing. She smiled, \"Yep, that's you.\"  Kyle grinned, \"Well then, it's time that the Elven Kingdom got ready, isn't it?\"  Fiona glared, \"Still say this is all your fault.\"  \"It is.\" Kyle said, concern creasing his face, \"No one can justify what I have done. I'm not much more than a...\"    \"... Monster.\" Abigail finished her analysis.  Huh! She was trying to actually think something through!  So... The Facts:   Stuck in limbo.  Maybe even the Limbo.    Hate making lists.  She killed a ghost.  Lists barely make sense.  She had a psychotic break earlier thinking she was Death itself.  Wes called her  a  Reaper.  She felt completely out of control whenever it happened.   Abigail sighed heavily and leaned back against the brickwork in despair...   She had always known there was darkness in her, every Vitamancer who had ever seen her had gone running for the hills...   That was her secret.   She was cursed... And now...   She was cursed for real.   Stuck in Limbo.  She sighed heavily, and then blinked as she saw Professor Duke pause in the packed hallway, and turn to face her.  Her eyes lit up, \"You can see me?!\"  The Professor walked over slowly through the milling soldiers and crouched, \"How can you be here, Abigail?\"  She winced, \"I... I don't know... I saw Kyle's memories... Then I was here, and there was... A ghost... He said he brought me here. Saved me and trapped me so he could take Kyle on... And then... I...\"  Duke frowned, \"The Reaper in you came out and killed Anderson.\"  Abigail stared, \"... Yeah.\"  Duke nodded slowly, \"Anderson had used this castle as his hiding place from the Reapers... I am deeply sorry that you have seen what hides in you.\"  Abigail clenched her fists, bursting into tears, \"What in the Shadowlands is wrong with me?\"  Duke shook his head, stroking her cheek, \"It is not anything that is wrong. It is a privilege, an honour, and a hard life that you have been handed... Since the ice cave, you have been awoken. You are a... Reaper...\"  Abigail stared at him, \"I... I just lose... Control...\"  Duke nodded, \"For now... Abigail, a Reaper hasn't been born in my lifetime. They were only legends, even to me... But, the idea is simple. The Other Side chooses a powerful mage, before they are born, and selects them to be their force in the world. You will right wrongs, reward the righteous, and restore balance between this world and the Other Side.\"  Abigail frowned, \"So... I'm like... The sword of the Other Side?\"  Duke shrugged, \"You also reward and help... But, yes.\"  Abigail stood up, \"Take me there.\"  Duke frowned, his branches creaking, \"Take you... Where?\"  \"The Other Side.\" The nymph growled, her scales flashing red, \"I mean it.\"  Duke shook his head, \"I have not been to the Other Side in generations... I would not wish it on anybody.\"  Abigail reached out in anger, grabbing Duke's neck, and lifted him off the ground, and her voice echoed, \"Take me there!\"  Duke glanced around as the hallway paused, staring, and then he dropped to the ground, Abigail's grip vanishing as she became ghost-like, the shock hitting her.  Duke brushed himself down, and then his shoulders bulged, twigs growing out from it, surrounding the both of them in a cocoon.  The Professor sighed, \"You stepped back into the world of the living, just now... The Reaper is passion and purpose. You had both. You controlled it, instead of being controlled by it.\"  Abigail crossed her arms, \"I don't care.\"  The professor cocked his head, \"You should... If you learn to control it completely... You would no longer be the will of the Other Side in the world... They would send more Reapers after... You.\"  Abigail winced, \"And if you took me there... And they thought I could go rogue... There'd be no coming back.\"  Duke nodded slowly.  She sighed heavily, \"Awesome... So now what? You resurrect me?\"  Duke shook his head, \"Resurrection of another being for more than a short time is a crime against the Other Side. You would destroy me for it.\"  Abigail winced, \"Awesome... How many rules are there to Necromancy?\"  \"Millions.\" Duke said carefully, \"Necromancy is not a skill... It comes from negotiating... You promise someone from the Other Side something, and in return, they give you their own magic... The contract is what binds you, and allows you to do what you can.\"  Abigail frowned, \"... Kyle?\"  Duke's face fell, his wooden face revealing pained emotion, in a way Abigail had never thought it could, \"Kyle has promised his soul.\"  She stared, \"Wha... What?\"  Duke shrugged, \"To save you and Fiona, Kyle gave up everything that was his to give... There's no competition between you and Fiona for his heart... The Other Side will destroy him if he doesn't pay.\"  Abigail swallowed, \"That's... That's why I'm here isn't it... To kill Kyle?\"  Duke shook his head, \"You would not kill him. He would become a prisoner... But Kyle has not yet broke his contract.\"  Abigail sighed heavily, curling up on the floor of branches, \"So... How do I get back?\"  Duke shrugged, \"I am not a Reaper, and you use magic that is beyond that of a Necromancer... A different, more pure magic... It is up to you to find it and bring yourself back. I can advise, but little else.\"  Abigail sighed as the branches receded, \"Thank you...\"    Candice stood on the rooftop, looking at the military camps outside the city walls, their fires dotted the landscape. She knew they were there, but still struggled to understand it.  None of that had been there when she had looked down at the city.  Kyle must have cast a massive illusion to keep all that from sight...  She heard a small pop and spun, staring as she saw Kyle ruffling his hair, and muttering.  \"Kilroy.\" She growled, and he turned and rolled his eyes, \"Really do not have the time, Silvergate.\"  She clenched her fists, \"My family is dead because of you!\"  Kyle vanished with another pop, and Candice glared at the empty space.  How dare he?    Kyle reappeared in the military planning office, \"Bellum!\"  The half dragon glanced up from a map, \"Kyle?\"  He smiled tightly, \"Just a projection. I don't have long. Dwarves are attacking the Elven Kingdom. Tens of thousands. It's four hours till dawn, there.\"  Bellum cringed, \"Holy mothers... What can we do?\"  Kyle winced, \"Tell Isaac Isaac where I am. Get the trolls coming to us. I hope racial hatred will do the rest... But the trolls are the only ones who can help.\"  \"Kilroy!\" Came an angry voice from behind him and Kyle spun, \"Unless you can defeat thirty thousand dwarfish berserkers, I don't give a rat's ass, Silvergate.\"  She trembled with rage, \"There are underground tunnels between the Elvish Kingdom and the Dwarfish Stronghold. They enter into the bank beneath the palace, on the Elvish side.\"  Kyle paused, \"Holy... Thank you... Any ideas how to stop them?\"  Silvergate nodded, \"Hold them off till dawn, and then open another Gateway, back here. Send half this army through.\"  Kyle laughed, \"It took both Bellum and I to open a portal for one man.\"  \"You are not Professor Duke.\" Candice sneered, \"He knows more than you.\"  Kyle frowned, \"It takes raw power.\"  \"No, it does not.\" Duke said, sliding through a nearby wall, \"I will handle, now, go Kyle.\"  He vanished with a pop.",

            "text": "Chapter Sixteen\n\n\n\n\nAbigail stared at the room, feeling as if it were empty.\n\n\nKyle had come and gone, before he'd seen her.\n\n\n... He was with Fiona...\n\n\nThat hurt far more than it should of. He was fighting an army, trying to reestablish peace in this fragile world...\n\n\nBut all she could think about was holding his hand in her own.\n\n\nDancing in the water... \n\n\nKyle's crooked smile...\n\n\nAbigail felt embarrassed as she blushed, her whole body flushing, and then remembered only Duke could see her.\n\n\nShe walked over to the military map, and frowned as she looked at it, as Bellum placed some more pins.\n\n\n\"The school is being surrounded...\" She whispered in surprise, looking at the blue pins dotted around. Glancing over to where Bellum was looking she saw green pins, and frowned, \"An alliance?\"\n\n\n\"The Bloodbound Pact.\" Draco whispered, and Abigail looked at him in surprise, suddenly feeling less substantial... She kept doing that.\n\n\nComing and going.\n\n\nDraco waved his hand, \"Pixies here, dwarves there... And we know there are rogue elements within the Elven Kingdom\u2026\"\n\n\nAbigail cringed, \"Either of them going to get out of this alive?\"\n\n\nDraco didn't answer, probably because he could no longer see her.\n\n\nShe'd faded back into Limbo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle reappeared with a pop beside her, and Fiona frowned, \"News?\"\n\n\n\"Protect yourself, now.\" Kyle growled, glaring around the room, \"Cast a spell. Right now.\"\n\n\nFiona felt the urgency, so despite her confusion, she chanted quietly, \"Luti lateris, protegat ossa ista omnia nubes mihi.\"\n\n\nAs the spell snapped into place she felt something hit her, and Fiona groaned, feeling a crackle of magic, and turned, seeing a spear embedded into a stone pillar that had appeared from nowhere.\n\n\nShe spread her hands, anger racing through her, \"Who dares attack the House of Applesilver?\"\n\n\n\"I do.\" Came a deep rumbling voice from the shadows, as a figure stepped forth from a door that had once been nothing more than a painting.\n\n\nThe black curls that made up his beard tangled to his feet, his whole body almost seemed to have been carved from stone, and the eyes inset into this formidable enemy where anything but enchanting.\n\n\nThe dwarf stood in the open, his fist holding another spear, but her eyes were drawn to his head, where a crown of gold lay.\n\n\nHe bowed slightly, \"I am Igor, King Under the Mountain.\"\n\n\nShe glared, \"I am Fiona Applesilver, Queen of all you see.\"\n\n\nThe dwarf shrugged, \"And yet, there appears to be much I cannot see\u2026 Who was it that warned you of my attack?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"That was just a lucky guess.\"\n\n\nFiona smiled softly, \"You know the way of mages\u2026 We all have secrets.\"\n\n\n\"My queen, please.\" The dwarf smiled, sending chills down her spine, \"Though you may be a renowned terramancer, I too have magic of my own. Most dwarves do. Something to do with working rock day and night.\"\n\n\nShe shrugged, \"So\u2026 An answer for an answer.\"\n\n\nThe dwarf frowned, stroking his beard, \"So be it\u2026 May I amend my question?\"\n\n\nFiona smiled, watching him, fighting the adrenaline coursing through her, \"Are we not all civilised here? Please do.\"\n\n\nThe dwarf-king smiled, slowly beginning to pace in a circle around her, \"What do you know of my purpose here?\"\n\n\n\"Nothing beyond what I can guess.\" Fiona said tightly and attempted a smile, \"The Bloodbound Pact has returned\u2026 If indeed, it ever went away.\"\n\n\nIgor smiled and nodded, \"It did not\u2026 But it did\u2026 To your kind\u2026 You forgot the sacred oaths that we swore\u2026 We bound bloodlines together, with Aimimancy, for all eternity\u2026 And yet\u2026 Your elvish kind\u2026 You obliterated the royal bloodline, and establish a new one. One who will not take pity on this Earth, or it's peoples\u2026\"\n\n\nFiona nodded slowly, \"So\u2026 Have you come to re-establish the Bloodbound Pact? Or destroy it forever?\"\n\n\nIgor paused in midstride, and glanced towards her, \"Is this your question, my Queen?\"\n\n\nShe nodded, \"Yes, my King.\"\n\n\nThe dwarf frowned and scratched his beard, \"Well, to be frank, milady, we never considered that you might turn your back upon Kyle Kilroy.\"\n\n\nFiona blinked, \"Is that so? Am I not bound by my bloodline to the duty of the Elvish People?\"\n\n\nThe dwarf nodded slowly, \"Aimimancy again, wasn't it? And then your dad killed the mancer?\"\n\n\nShe shrugged, \"I was barely a babe when I was bound. I have no memory of it.\"\n\n\nThe dwarf sighed heavily, \"Well, you have me at a quandary, my Queen\u2026 The Bloodbound Pact is weak without all three\u2026 Together, we can change the world\u2026 But I know not how to trust a woman half the world believes is obsessed with Kyle Kilroy.\"\n\n\nFiona felt fear ripple through her as Kyle suddenly spoke firmly, a flash of fire appearing around him, \"Then why don't you ask me?\"\n\n\nThe dwarf through the spear and it went through Kyle, clattering on the floor.\n\n\nThe necromancer rolled his eyes, \"I'm not actually here, idiot.\"\n\n\nIgor sneered, \"You are an abomination!\"\n\n\n\"I know.\" Kyle shrugged, \"But what choice did the Pact leave me?\"\n\n\nIgor blinked, \"What?\"\n\n\n\"You sent armies. Multiple. You tried to obliterate the College of History and Magic, from the face of the earth\u2026 You tried to kill the only two friends I have ever known\u2026\"1 Kyle glared at the dwarf, clenching his fists, \"You destroyed my home, came after my family, because of what I could be... Well, you made me into this!\"\n\n\nIgor stared, \"You could have died.\"\n\n\nFiona stared from one to the other, \"The Pact butchered the College?\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"They emptied the Shadowlands... They sent vampires at a school, because they were scared of what a student might one day be... And you know, without that fear, I would never have invented the spell that allowed me to survive death... I became a monster... Because you, were far worse.\"\n\n\nIgor sneered, raising his hands, muttering and Fiona glared at him, \"Do you really want to die? That isn't Kyle. It's a projection... He isn't here. He can't hurt you, and you can't hurt him. Only words matter... And yours are sorely lacking. What defence does the Pact have for itself?\"\n\n\nThe dwarf glared at her, \"Necromancy is one of the worst sins there is. The consequences for the entire world matter.\"\n\n\nKyle cocked his head, \"Fill me in. Let me know this secret knowledge, dwarf. Maybe I'll just go back to the Other Side.\"\n\n\nIgor sighed heavily, \"The Other Side will come for you, when you don't pay. They will send an army of Reapers, creatures with their own magic, the ability to steal souls. They will devastate the entire world, hunting for you.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"I've struck my deal. The Reapers have no need to hunt me... I know when and where my soul will be destroyed, and I won't fight it.\"\n\n\nIgor's eyes widened, \"You promised the Other Side your soul? Why?\"\n\n\n\"To protect her!\" Kyle yelled, pointing at Fiona, \"Have you not been listening? You caused all this!\"\n\n\nIgor shook his head, \"I do not believe it. I can't. Friendship is not worth so much.\"\n\n\nKyle clenched his fists, \"Truly? Then take a closer look at Fi. I had to save her from some of your vampire compatriots.\"\n\n\nIgor glanced over at her, and Fiona swallowed nervously, the man sizing her up, \"What... What are you?\"\n\n\nFiona glared, \"The Elven Queen who owns the stone you are standing on.\"\n\n\n\"... With fangs...\" Igor whispered, staring and Fiona's eyes widened, glancing over at Kyle, \"You... Saved me...\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"From most of the hunger, from daylight... Not from turning. Sorry, haven't really had time to break the news gently.\"\n\n\nFiona clenched her fists together, \"Why? Because you've been off saving Abigail?\"\n\n\nThere was a snapping sound, and the world seemed to become freezing, as Fiona saw Igor freeze in place.\n\n\nKyle sighed heavily and sat down, \"We've got all the time in the world now, Fi.\"\n\n\nShe glared as she leaned against the wall, \"Never said you could call me that.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"What do you want from me, Fiona? I've barely been able to keep tabs on you and Abigail, let alone enough for us to sit and laugh about how bad a meal is... I can do stuff like freeze the world, like now, but it means I'll be weaker against whatever threat is currently rearing its head... I don't have a lot to give.\"\n\n\nThe elf glared at him, \"So? What? Am I supposed to forgive you for putting us all through this?\"\n\n\nKyle frowned, \"What would have happened if they killed me, Fiona? There were seven vampiric armies. Trolls and elves. The three human empires. All in one place... As much carnage and destruction as there was... It could have been so much worse... As it is, it's a fragile empire versus an ages old alliance. I'd say we have better odds at getting through this.\"\n\n\nFiona fought herself, understanding the politics and the machinations for war that had long been in the making. Kyle had simply been an excuse.\n\n\nBut she didn't want to accept that.\n\n\nShe wanted to be angry at him.\n\n\nKyle cocked his head, \"Fiona?\"\n\n\nShe glared at him, \"I'm annoyed. Can't you give a girl a break?\"\n\n\nKyle stood up slowly, \"You need to move, Fi... Something else is here.\"\n\n\nHer eyes widened, and she threw herself across the floor, the window shattered, an elf standing up with a laugh.\n\n\nHe was male, tall, even for an elf. His black hair was tied in a neat ponytail, and in his hand, he held a scythe.\n\n\nKyle tensed, and yelled, \"Run, Fi!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle stared at the elf, laughing and tossing his weapon from hand to hand.\n\n\n\"What do you want, Reaper?\"\n\n\nThe elf cocked his head, his voice echoing darkly, \"Kyle Kilroy. Your debts are not yet due.\"\n\n\nHe clenched his fists, \"Why are you here, Reaper? If not for my soul, then what?\"\n\n\nThe elf rolled his eyes, \"The tallies are unbalanced. The elf owes the Other Side her life. Where once there was a queen, now there is a vampire. Unbound from every law or curse that was imposed upon that kind.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"Her debt is mine. I brought her back.\"\n\n\nThe elf shrugged, \"I am due a soul. I will Reap.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded slowly, \"Then reap mine.\"\n\n\n\"I cannot. Though your debt is not due, it still exists. It will be taken.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, thinking as fast as he could, and he swallowed, \"Then I appeal.\"\n\n\nThe Reaper sneered, \"On what grounds?\"\n\n\n\"Fiona Applesilver and Abigail Ignis are both bound to me... And the Other Side has placed an undue hold on Abigail.\" Kyle stated harshly, and the Reaper paused, \"Abigail Ignis has no hold on her.\"\n\n\nKyle glared, \"She did not die. The Reaper in her awoke, but she did not cross the threshold to the Other Side in death. She came close, but did not cross.\"\n\n\nThe Reaper paused, \"Your appeal will be heard... Others are needed. Look for our decision at dawn.\"\n\n\nThe elf vanished, fading as if he were a shadow.\n\n\nKyle breathed out a sigh of relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail paused, staring at the figure as he stepped out of the ground, \"Now what?\"\n\n\nThe man's voice echoed, a deep rumble, \"Abigail Ignis.\"\n\n\nShe swallowed nervously, \"You're a Reaper?\"\n\n\nThe man blinked, staring at her, \"I... Am... But... Are you not?\"\n\n\nShe shrugged, \"That's what everyone keeps telling me.\"\n\n\nThe Reaper struggled for a moment, \"Then how is it that you are not channeling Messormancy? How is that you can enter the world of the living?\"\n\n\nAbigail blinked, feeling the active curiosity in the man, and she swallowed, \"Just... Hold still... I have an... Idea.\"\n\n\nThe Reaper stiffened, but didn't run.\n\n\nShe put her hand on his chest, tingling as his life, emotions and memories washed over her. The hundreds of years since becoming a Reaper, bound to walk Limbo, and strike down the poor souls who imbalanced the world.\n\n\nAbigail breathed in and out.\n\n\nShe focused carefully, forming a ball of Vitamancy, an incredibly complex shape, made from twisting overlapping strands into repeating octagonal shapes. As she formed it she smiled softly, \"It's nice to meet you, Braun.\"\n\n\nA tear slipped down his cheek, \"I... Was... Braun...\"\n\n\nThen she focused, steeling her will and pushing, the soul binding to the body below her grasp.\n\n\nAs she did she fell, tumbling away from the world into the void, but she had expected it, and stood solid, her scythe appearing in her hand as she growled, \"I am Death. I embrace it.\"\n\n\nBut this time it was no soul that streaked towards her. A headless cowl screamed at her, another scythe swiping towards her.\n\n\nShe struck it aside, surprised by the strength and ferocity as the spirit of the Reaper spun and went to tear her apart.\n\n\nAbigail winced, noticing that with each blow the Reaper was knocking her backwards in this void without up or down. She growled, hissing, her scales standing on end, turning red, and fading to black, as her hair turned white, the will to destroy coursing through her like a river that feeds the ocean.\n\n\nAbigail felt something vibrating in her chest, feeling more power than she could comprehend swamping over her, and she seized it, striking hard.\n\n\nThe Reaper tried to deflect her blow, but the scythe was sharpened by her rage, by the magic that flowed through her. As it curved towards the creature the wind was ripped asunder, forming wisps of the neverwhere.\n\n\nHer blade cut through the weapon of her enemy, turning it to splinters as she tore the soul apart.\n\n\nAbigail collapsed onto her knees, shaking, and she heard a thud, glancing up to see Braun lying on the cobblestone, twitching.\n\n\nShe hoped she had made the right decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuke stared at the man shivering in the bed, and glanced at Abigail, \"You're sure he was a Reaper?\"\n\n\nThe nymph rolled her eyes, \"Yes. Totally. His voice echoed, and I saw his soul... And killed something that looked like a Reaper. It used a bloody scythe... I'm sure he was possessed by a Reaper.\"\n\n\nDuke blinked, \"A theory, Miss Ignis?\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"I don't know... I did to him, what I did to the ice golem... But instead of seeing his soul, I saw a spirit. I destroyed it.\"\n\n\nDuke nodded slowly, \"So you believe the Reaper is not a part of you, but possesses you, in some active way.\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"Braun could tell us more... He was surprised that I wasn't a permanent channel for... He called it Messormancy.\"\n\n\nDuke nodded slowly, \"I do not know if he will survive... But I believe you may have defeated a Reaper, Miss Ignis.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"Professor... There's a... Problem...\"\n\n\nHe nodded slowly, \"I see a strand of white in your hair.\"\n\n\nShe winced, \"I think that'd be a symptom...\"\n\n\nDuke glanced at her, \"Of what in particular?\"\n\n\nAbigail ran a hand through her hair nervously, \"Braun was confused as to how I could pull back from the Reaper... And how I could cross into the world of the living... I think... I think I'm different. I don't feel like I have something in me... I feel like the Reaper is just another magic, halfway under my control.\"\n\n\nDuke winced, \"How most Aimimancers feel... So... You think you are somehow different...?\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"I feel like I'm Death.\"\n\n\nDuke blinked slowly, considering, \"That... I can see why you hesitated.\"\n\n\nThe nymph glared at him, \"Thanks.\"\n\n\nDuke sighed heavily, \"I do not mean to insult you, Miss Ignis\u2026 Feeling like an embodiment of the concept that is the end of life, is peculiar to most of the mundane peoples in this world. To those of us with power, it would force us to believe that we had stepped over the edge into insanity\u2026 But you do not feel that, and I do not believe it.\"\n\n\nShe looked at him sheepishly, \"Really?\"\n\n\nDuke shrugged, \"Truly, I do\u2026 But we have more pressing matters\u2026 In my library, I once possessed a tome written in a dead language, that spoke of Merosean Magic\u2026 They share the root word and meaning, of Messormancy.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled grimly, \"You're office was destroyed, like everything else.\"\n\n\nDuke nodded, \"But, we have options open to us\u2026 I gave up on traveling to the past, when I discovered that once observed, events cannot be changed\u2026 But I think that we should still be able to observe. See where the book ends up.\"\n\n\nShe shrugged, \"Awesome\u2026 So we're going back in time? \u2026 This is going to suck, isn't it?\"\n\n\nDuke nodded, \"Indeed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona paused out of breath, and looked around herself fearfully, at all the elves frozen in place.\n\n\nSome wore the looks of the everyday - happiness, stress, anger, and boredom.\n\n\nOthers didn't.\n\n\nThey were frozen in a moment of terror, a place of fear.\n\n\nAll around them, dwarves were leaping from rooftops, axes and maces in hand.\n\n\nTheir faces were different, stony, determined, and wrathful.\n\n\nFiona winced, fighting back an urge to tear them all limb from limb.\n\n\nShe knew there would be consequences to attacking whilst this place was frozen.\n\n\nShe just didn't know what.\n\n\nFiona ran a hand tough her hair, it wasn't just a desire to tear them apart, was it?\n\n\nShe wanted the destruction.\n\n\nShe wanted to see mangled flesh and blood pouring into the air.\n\n\nShe raised her hand delicately to her teeth, finding four fangs, that immediately cut her hand open.\n\n\nShe winced, staring at her hand as blood drops froze un the air as they separated from her, and a knew feeling washed over her.\n\n\nShe didn't just want destruction.\n\n\nShe had the power to do so, and it was right in front of her.\n\n\nShe touched a blood droplet softly, and pushed her will against it, forcing it to change shape.\n\n\nNothing happened.\n\n\nFiona let out a soft growl, trying to force it, and she saw the droplet begin to quiver, reality fighting for control.\n\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\n\nShe spun around, blinking as colour washed back into the world, \"Kyle.\"\n\n\nHe clenched his fists, \"Seriously, Fiona? You want to learn Aimimancy?\"\n\n\nShe winced, \"I didn't! I don't think... I... Kyle what in the Shades happened to me? Back at the College?\"\n\n\nHe sighed heavily, shoulders drooping, \"You were dying. Throat slashed out by a vampire. Draco and Maidr were barely keeping you alive... And I finally managed to bring myself back fully... So I trashed the place. I took you to the infirmary, and pasted anyone in the way... Word spread I was back, and the fighting sort of eased off... I saved Abigail, and came back to you... But I couldn't heal you. I could find the vampire in you, like a parasite made of Aimimancy, wrapped around your lifeforce... The Vitamancy keeping you alive and the Aimimancy that was the vampire virus were nearly indistinguishable. Can't destroy one without the other, so I did the next best thing... I stopped you from dying, and fully awakening the vampire in you, and then I put a decent dozen protection spells on you, to remove the weaknesses of the vampire. Sunlight and so on.\"\n\n\nFiona stared him, \"I really am a vampire?\"\n\n\n\"No.\" Kyle shook his head, \"You never died.\"\n\n\n\"Why didn't you stop all this, Kyle?\" Fiona glared, tears welling in her eyes, \"You could have stopped it all, earlier!\"\n\n\nKyle sighed heavily, looking at the ground, \"I spent nearly a thousand years, looking for answers, Fiona... A way to save both you and Abigail. Some way, any way, to get you out of this situation... It took me that long to find a way.\"\n\n\nFiona glared, \"It's your fault we're in this! You started a bloody war!\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"I did... But the war was an excuse... A way to gather and bind a series of armies together... Something is coming, Fiona, something worse than anything I've done... I just wanted to see you alive at the other side of it.\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, \"What's coming?\"\n\n\nHe shook his head, \"If I tell you, then it is going to be worse. All of this.\"\n\n\n\"I deserve to know, Kyle.\" Fiona growled, fighting an instinct to rip out his throat.\n\n\nThe young boy she had fallen in love with sighed heavily, and wiped a tear from his eye, \"Vampires come from somewhere... A particular place in the Shades... It's what sucked the Shades dry, destroyed the land... It's what is sustaining the ice age, the world over... It created the vampires as a way of spreading a disease, making inroads to spread it's influence.\"\n\n\nFiona frowned, \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\n\"There's... There's a gateway to the Other Side in the Shades.\" Kyle said hesitantly, swallowing nervously, and he shrugged, \"There. I said it.\"\n\n\nA shiver went through her entire body, and the elf queen swallowed, \"The..  Other Side?\"\n\n\nKyle smiled weakly, \"It's worse than you know.\"\n\n\nFiona shrugged, \"What do I know? Kyle? What does anyone but you and Professor Duke know about the Other Side?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"It's hard to describe... But think of vampires as the wild dogs, not the people that trained them, made them, and forged them from the souls they have stolen from the living world.\"\n\n\nFiona swallowed, \"Shades...\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"It's complicated... Let's... Let's deal with the Bloodbound first... We'll need them too, if we hope to stop everyone.\"\n\n\nFiona winced, \"The Pact need to join a Necromancer, a vampiric queen, and an army of the dead against the Other Side? ... This is a crap day.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"Kinda... But, I didn't freeze time.\"\n\n\nShe glanced over to the horizon, seeing a glimmer and grinned, \"You cheat, Kyle.\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"I'm not alone here. There's a certain leader outside the walls, I need you to negotiate with.\"\n\n\nFiona swallowed, \"Isaac Isaac? The troll leader you cursed?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Yeah... He thought it best to destroy everything I love, which included you.\"\n\n\nHer ears turned pink, and Fiona tried to seize the moment. She reached out to Kyle, wanting to grab him and pull him in for a kiss.\n\n\nShe forgot he was just a projection.\n\n\nSo instead, there was an awkward stumble.\n\n\nKyle blushed, \"Uh... We don't have much time. The Pact needs to be stopped.\"\n\n\nThen he was.gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShadows take his burning soul!\n\n\nKyle swore at himself, embarrassment, regret, and more complicated feelings washing over him.\n\n\nHe'd completely missed it.\n\n\nHe had known Fiona had liked him, and he'd flirted with her, but it wasn't that simple.\n\n\nHe didn't know what to think.\n\n\nThe world was in danger, he'd already sold his soul, everything was incredibly dangerous, at tipping point... But he couldn't get two girls out of his head.\n\n\nKyle yanked himself apart, reforming on a rooftop, looking at the scene as dwarves and elves fought, tearing each other apart, and he felt an incredible tiredness wash over him.\n\n\nWhat was really the goal of all this?\n\n\nWhat was the point?\n\n\n\"About time.\" A deep voice.rumbled next to him, and Kyle spun, blinking, \"Professor Duke.\"\n\n\nThe old dryad shrugged, \"I am surprised you fought the depression for so long, Master Kilroy.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed heavily, \"Is there an army coming or not?\"\n\n\nThe dryad shook his head, \"I am not here for that. That will come later. For now, I am here to give you purpose again.\"\n\n\nKyle rolled his eyes, \"Truly.\"\n\n\nThe dryad glared at him, and Kyle felt the danger then. Danger he had not felt since dying.\n\n\nDuke paused and shook his head, \"Things are accelerating. The other young girl you care so deeply for has destroyed the Reaper who challenged you here.\"\n\n\nKyle went white, \"Destroyed a Reaper? There's going to be hell to pay.\"\n\n\n\"She destroyed the Reaper, not the man.\"\n\n\nDuke's soft tones made Kyle jump, and he swallowed, \"Reapers are... An infection? A possessor?\"\n\n\nDuke shrugged, \"Perhaps. There is not much more i can say... But in my quest to aid Miss Ignis, we will attempt to travel back before the College was destroyed. There is a book, which you once saw me studying, that mentions something akin to the magic Miss Ignis is discovering.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"I miss her.\"\n\n\nDuke shrugged, \"You have already sold your soul, Kyle... You have denied any closeness with either of these wonderful women. The best you can do is keep them alive.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded slowly, \"Protect Abigail, please.\"\n\n\nDuke shook his head, \"I will need protection, not her... She defeated a Reaper... I am no longer certain that she is just a Reaper... Perhaps, something more.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"How much do you know of Reapers, Professor? Are they just the foot soldiers in this war-to-be? Or the elite?\"\n\n\nDuke glared, \"This war is here, Kilroy. It was here long before your birth. I established the Silvergate clan to protect the borders. I established the Applesilver family to ensure the Pact would never again interfere. I founded the College of History and Magic, along with seven others, so we could forge an army in this world!\"\n\n\nThe vehemence of the anger hit Kyle, but more, it was how long Duke had been fighting.\n\n\nKyle winced, \"I didn't mean to start all this.\"\n\n\nDuke shrugged, \"But you did... It was your attitude, Kyle... Until you, a Necromancer was a creature of patience, of tact. Predictable. Then along comes a young brash Aimimancer, and he delves so quickly and deeply into a new magic that he must be eliminated. Not only that, he shows a large amount of unpredictability. Able to forge new spells with the least amount of thought, ingenious in the way he finds more power... The Other Side is right to be terrified of you.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded slowly, \"Not yet, they aren't.\"\n\n\nDuke creaked as he leaned forward, \"If you aren't careful Kyle, you will tip the balance of favour in our enemy's direction.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed heavily, \"I met her, Professor.\"\n\n\nDuke stepped backwards hurriedly, \"You met the Lady?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"That is with whom I made my deal. Not with one of the court, but with her.\"\n\n\nDuke shook his head, \"The others can be reasoned with... But her will is iron... Why?\"\n\n\nKyle smiled tightly, \"The others would take back their power if they see me make a single move against them. She... Would not. She would allow me to face her with her own strength.\"\n\n\nDuke shook his head, \"But... To even speak with her... Is insanity.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"I saw her face Duke... And you need to know.\"\n\n\nDuke frowned, \"I am surprised you were allowed to return to the world of the living.\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"Not the point... Duke, she was a nymph.\"\n\n\nThe professor stared at Kyle for a long time and then nodded slowly, \"You believe she and Abigail are connected? That Abigail is not a mere Reaper, but connected to their Queen?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"It's only your doubts that Abigail is just a Reaper that sparked the thought.\"\n\n\nDuke frowned, \"We will tread carefully.\"\n\n\nKyle clenched a fist, \"If you fail to protect her, Duke, I will destroy you.\"\n\n\nThe old Necromancer looked at the young, struggling not to laugh.\n\n\nKyle sneered, \"The deal for my soul, professor, was a kiss.\"\n\n\nDuke froze, staring at Kyle, \"The Lady would kiss one of your choosing?\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"I intended it for myself, once all this is over... But I would gladly make it yours if you do not protect Abigail.\"\n\n\nThe professor shrugged, \"So be it.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled and turned, dismissing the professor's projection with more force than Duke would have thought possible.\n\n\nHis attention snapped to the task at hand, and a ring of flames sprang up around him, racing in a circle.\n\n\nNext the edge of the roof was torn away, the stone floating upwards and became a ring around him.\n\n\nAbove those two rings, a third formed, around his head height. The wind whipped itself, becoming a visible vortex.\n\n\nKyle smiled.grimly as he saw the world beginning to move, the sky beginning to swirl overhead, and he stretched out a hand, the trees in the plaza below exploding, water flying upwards and formed another spinning circle above him.\n\n\nFinally, Kyle took a blade from his pocket and cut his hand, the blood flying upwards and forming it's own circle.\n\n\nKyle glared at the world, as the sky turned black, rain beginning to pour down. He spoke, his voice amplified, \"I am Kyle Kilroy. If any dare face me, do so now.\"\n\n\nThe fighting slowed and then stopped as each dwarf and elf.turned to face him.\n\n\nKyle clenched a fist, the circles sprang outwards, encompassing the entire city, and he floated upwards to the center.\n\n\nHe glared down, \"The Pact believes what I am to be an abomination. They mean to destroy this city, and what I care for... But this city is protected.\"\n\n\nA dwarven commander hefted his axe and then tossed it, the blade flying towards Kyle.\n\n\nHe felt.shock hit him.\n\n\nHe recognized the enchantment on the weapon.\n\n\nThis is how he had died the first time.\n\n\nFear and agony washed over him.\n\n\nHe couldn't think.\n\n\nHe couldn't move.\n\n\nThe axe flew closer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Isaac burst through the stone wall, barely pausing before plowing through the army in his wake, his hand grabbing the small weapon out of the air and crushing it.\n\n\nHe dropped it to the ground, glaring, \"I be Isaac Isaac. I lead Trolls. This man mine to kill.\"\n\n\nThe dwarves slowly backed away, and Isaac Isaac began to think something was different. Wrong.\n\n\nHad he hurt himself?\n\n\nHe looked at his hand, but it was intact. Fine.\n\n\nHe felt a human hand touch his shoulder and glared at Kyle, who smiled softly, \"They're waiting for you to die. The blade was cursed in the same way they first killed me.\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac paused, \"And I not dead why?\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, \"Trolls may turn to stone in sunlight... But no troll can be harmed by magic. Moved, yes. Harmed... No.\"\n\n\nThe troll leader smiled slowly, \"Kyle Kilroy is an enemy of my enemy. Friend.\"\n\n\nKyle stared, \"You would forgive me?\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac shook his head, \"I will make a meal of your bones... But maybe when you died of old age.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Good enough... Now, um... The Bloodbound Pact...\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac looked down, wincing as he saw dwarves with swords, axes and shields. Glaring at him, and preparing.\n\n\nHe smiled, \"Troll Hoarde ten minutes out.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, \"My army is half a day out.\"\n\n\nIsaac Isaac clenched his fists, and spoke loudly, \"Little elves!\"\n\n\nHe paused, revolted, \"Little elves... Trolls will forgive all, if together we defeat Pact.\"\n\n\nA clear strong voice spoke from a nearby rooftop, her voice nearly musical, \"As Queen of the elves... I accept.\"\n\n\nThen everything erupted into movement.\n\n\nIsaac Isaac roared as blade bit into his skin, his fists were in constant movement. Beating and bludgeoning.\n\n\nThe ground beneath him was turning black, his hands were cracked and weary.\n\n\nBlood poured down his back, his arms.\n\n\nHe was being torn to pieces by an army of undergrounders. Isaac Isaac let loose a roar.\n\n\nHis voice filled the air.\n\n\nIt was the sound of agony.\n\n\nThe sound of pain.\n\n\nThe sound of fear.\n\n\nIt was... The sound of... Sadness... True deep hurt, inside... \n\n\nHe knew it as he roared.\n\n\nIt was the sound of grief.\n\n\nThere was a resounding thunderclap, and for a moment, his attackers fell backwards, burned and beaten.\n\n\nKyle appeared in front of him, and the handle of a sword grew out of the ground. Then Kilroy was gone.\n\n\nIsaac Isaac seized the handle, finding with astonishment that it fit his hand perfectly, and he drew it up.\n\n\nThe silver blade glistened in the rain, reflecting the fires all around.\n\n\nIsaac Isaac smiled as he raised it against his enemies.\n\n\nHe would call the sword, \nWar\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiona fell backwards, the stone around her arm shattering to dust.\n\n\nThe dwarf sneered at her, his fingers flexing, \"No elf is better with stone that a dwarf.\"\n\n\nFiona glared at the mancer, her fists tensing, \"I think you'd be surprised.\"\n\n\nShe didn't get a moment to show off, however, as the dwarf burst into flames.\n\n\nShe leaped to her feet, and off the rooftop. As she hit the ground it yanked upwards, molding to her body with a mutter.\n\n\nShe punched, shattering the face of a surprised axe-wielding opponent.\n\n\nFiona spun, idly blocking a blow, and stared at the storm that was Kyle.\n\n\nThere had to be ten thousand dwarves swarming over the capital, and half of them were focused on one man.\n\n\nShe could see him, suspended in the air, made of fire, surrounded by stone and wind.\n\n\nKyle was beating back nearly a thousand soldiers, but all the same... She couldn't help feeling that he was losing.\n\n\nHow could they win this fight?\n\n\nIf he couldn't?\n\n\nFiona felt rage and fear boiling up inside her.\n\n\nShe had to stop the Pact here, there was too much at stake.\n\n\nShe didn't care that Kyle thought they would need them, they had to be stopped.\n\n\nHer hands reached down and touched the soft soil, a shell forming over her, releasing her into her own cave.\n\n\nFiona was left in the dark as blades clanged, elves screamed and trolls roared.\n\n\nShe touched the soft dirt, taking in it's scent, trying to understand it.\n\n\nHer will hardened, becoming iron.\n\n\nFiona gripped the earth, magic flowing through her like she was a waterfall, and she spoke quietly.\n\n\nHer voice was firm, unable to be questioned, as her authority echoed. \n\n\n\"Videte nunc, exaudi clamorem meum, exaudi vocem meum.\nHeed me now, heed my cry, listen to my voice.\"\n\n\nThe ground beneath her began to shake, each particle responding in kind to her command.\n\n\nFiona felt the shell that was her cave begin to shake, her attackers trying to get to her, and destroy her.\n\n\n\"Liga mihi, ligaveris super terram, usque perpetuum addicere.\nBind to me, bind to the earth, bind to forever.\"\n\n\nSweat began to pour off her face, dripping to the ground, as she focused.\n\n\nMost spells were simply eight Latin words with strong conviction behind them, different emotions for different magics.\n\n\nRepeating the phrase in English doubled the power of the spell, but also the wear and tear on the caster, in many cases ending in death as the spell collapses before being finished.\n\n\nFiona had only known one man insane enough to bind several of those doubly-powerful phrases together\u2026 But what she was trying to do had never been done.\n\n\nIt was raw, powerful and entirely insane.\n\n\nShe smiled, Kyle must be rubbing off on her.\n\n\n\"Eaque militia let stare test temporis, in perpetuum.\nLet this spell stand the test of time, in perpetuum.\"\n\n\nThe ground was alive, every particle around her lit up with magic, waiting to be used\u2026 Begging.\n\n\nFiona winced, thinking on her words.\n\n\nThe words mattered\u2026 The eloquence leant its own power\u2026 She couldn't fight the feeling that Kyle would be able to do this better.\n\n\nBut he didn't have the will.\n\n\nHe wouldn't do what needed to be done.\n\n\nSo it was in her hands.\n\n\n\"Accipite regnum, accipe en elvish terrarum, mihi devincire.\nTake this kingdom, take the elvish lands, bind them to me.\"\n\n\nBlinding agony shot through her, and Fiona gasped, struggling.\n\n\nIt felt like a knife had burst through her heart.\n\n\nShe couldn't concentrate, couldn't focus.\n\n\nIt hurt. It hurt. It hurt.\n\n\nFiona let out a yell of anger, fighting the magic burning her for control, but finding little more than a slippery staircase.\n\n\nThis was too much, it was burning her out, overwhelming her before she was done.\n\n\nShe wasn't fighting a losing battle, it was already lost.\n\n\nWords tumbled from her mouth, weak, pathetic, but binding to the source of magic that was the remnants of an elvish princess.\n\n\n\"De terra illius regni, ut ligaretur pannis sanguine.\u000bFrom the earth of this kingdom, bind it my blood.\"\n\n\nThe magic shifted focus, the vibrations of the world around her changed.\n\n\nThe pitch was different, the frequency was alien, and relief from the pain poured down upon her.\n\n\nBefore Fiona could breathe a sigh of relief, a sense of nausea struck her, and she couldn't hold back.\n\n\nVomit pooled around her feet, the stench filling the small cavity she was hiding in.\n\n\nShe felt her face crinkle in disgust, but she was far from done.\n\n\n\"Sanguis en regnum tumultus. Tumultus terra mea.\nBind the kingdom to my blood. Bind the earth to my command.\"\n\n\nFiona felt like she'd just been round-house kicked in the face whilst a vampire attempted to suck the soul from her battered body.\n\n\nShe collapsed onto her knees involuntarily, gagging as she did.\n\n\nIt just had to be vomit, didn't it?\n\n\nCouldn't be flowers or something actually pleasant.\n\n\nShe smiled grimly.\n\n\nOnly two more commands, that's all she had to do\u2026 Then she would have cast the most powerful spell in the history of magic.\n\n\nHer mind was spent, the magic made her feel like she was slowly dissolving into the air, and she had no clue how the battle was raging around her.\n\n\nBut it didn't matter.\n\n\nOnly one thing mattered now.\n\n\nFinishing the spell.\n\n\n\"Amove lamia, nani et proditores regni, contere eos.\nRemove all vampires, dwarves and traitors from this kingdom, destroy them.\"\n\n\nFiona had intended to keep going, to finish the spell as quickly as she could.\n\n\nShe found herself instead on hands and knees, coughing violently, blood splattering on the ground.\n\n\nHer hands turned to claws in the soil, and she felt her forehead touch it.\n\n\nShe must be bent over in a ball, gasping for air as she was killed by the magic she was channelling.\n\n\nIt didn't matter.\n\n\nShe could die later.\n\n\n\"Exilio\u2026 membra\u2026 Sangui\u2026nis\u2026cursu\u2026 Foederis\u2026 dryadales\u2026 et\u2026 a\u2026 solo\u2026\nExile\u2026 all\u2026 members\u2026 of the\u2026 Blood\u2026bound\u2026 Pact\u2026 from\u2026 elvish\u2026 soil!\"\n\n\nThe last word became a shout, as the spell hardened and launched into effect.\n\n\nThe magic fled, the ground shook, as the magic sort to obey it's command.\n\n\nFiona fell sideways to the ground.",

            "text": "Abigail stared at the room, feeling as if it were empty.  Kyle had come and gone, before he'd seen her.  ... He was with Fiona...  That hurt far more than it should of. He was fighting an army, trying to reestablish peace in this fragile world...  But all she could think about was holding his hand in her own.  Dancing in the water...   Kyle's crooked smile...  Abigail felt embarrassed as she blushed, her whole body flushing, and then remembered only Duke could see her.  She walked over to the military map, and frowned as she looked at it, as Bellum placed some more pins.  \"The school is being surrounded...\" She whispered in surprise, looking at the blue pins dotted around. Glancing over to where Bellum was looking she saw green pins, and frowned, \"An alliance?\"  \"The Bloodbound Pact.\" Draco whispered, and Abigail looked at him in surprise, suddenly feeling less substantial... She kept doing that.  Coming and going.  Draco waved his hand, \"Pixies here, dwarves there... And we know there are rogue elements within the Elven Kingdom\u2026\"  Abigail cringed, \"Either of them going to get out of this alive?\"  Draco didn't answer, probably because he could no longer see her.  She'd faded back into Limbo.    Kyle reappeared with a pop beside her, and Fiona frowned, \"News?\"  \"Protect yourself, now.\" Kyle growled, glaring around the room, \"Cast a spell. Right now.\"  Fiona felt the urgency, so despite her confusion, she chanted quietly, \"Luti lateris, protegat ossa ista omnia nubes mihi.\"  As the spell snapped into place she felt something hit her, and Fiona groaned, feeling a crackle of magic, and turned, seeing a spear embedded into a stone pillar that had appeared from nowhere.  She spread her hands, anger racing through her, \"Who dares attack the House of Applesilver?\"  \"I do.\" Came a deep rumbling voice from the shadows, as a figure stepped forth from a door that had once been nothing more than a painting.  The black curls that made up his beard tangled to his feet, his whole body almost seemed to have been carved from stone, and the eyes inset into this formidable enemy where anything but enchanting.  The dwarf stood in the open, his fist holding another spear, but her eyes were drawn to his head, where a crown of gold lay.  He bowed slightly, \"I am Igor, King Under the Mountain.\"  She glared, \"I am Fiona Applesilver, Queen of all you see.\"  The dwarf shrugged, \"And yet, there appears to be much I cannot see\u2026 Who was it that warned you of my attack?\"  Kyle shrugged, \"That was just a lucky guess.\"  Fiona smiled softly, \"You know the way of mages\u2026 We all have secrets.\"  \"My queen, please.\" The dwarf smiled, sending chills down her spine, \"Though you may be a renowned terramancer, I too have magic of my own. Most dwarves do. Something to do with working rock day and night.\"  She shrugged, \"So\u2026 An answer for an answer.\"  The dwarf frowned, stroking his beard, \"So be it\u2026 May I amend my question?\"  Fiona smiled, watching him, fighting the adrenaline coursing through her, \"Are we not all civilised here? Please do.\"  The dwarf-king smiled, slowly beginning to pace in a circle around her, \"What do you know of my purpose here?\"  \"Nothing beyond what I can guess.\" Fiona said tightly and attempted a smile, \"The Bloodbound Pact has returned\u2026 If indeed, it ever went away.\"  Igor smiled and nodded, \"It did not\u2026 But it did\u2026 To your kind\u2026 You forgot the sacred oaths that we swore\u2026 We bound bloodlines together, with Aimimancy, for all eternity\u2026 And yet\u2026 Your elvish kind\u2026 You obliterated the royal bloodline, and establish a new one. One who will not take pity on this Earth, or it's peoples\u2026\"  Fiona nodded slowly, \"So\u2026 Have you come to re-establish the Bloodbound Pact? Or destroy it forever?\"  Igor paused in midstride, and glanced towards her, \"Is this your question, my Queen?\"  She nodded, \"Yes, my King.\"  The dwarf frowned and scratched his beard, \"Well, to be frank, milady, we never considered that you might turn your back upon Kyle Kilroy.\"  Fiona blinked, \"Is that so? Am I not bound by my bloodline to the duty of the Elvish People?\"  The dwarf nodded slowly, \"Aimimancy again, wasn't it? And then your dad killed the mancer?\"  She shrugged, \"I was barely a babe when I was bound. I have no memory of it.\"  The dwarf sighed heavily, \"Well, you have me at a quandary, my Queen\u2026 The Bloodbound Pact is weak without all three\u2026 Together, we can change the world\u2026 But I know not how to trust a woman half the world believes is obsessed with Kyle Kilroy.\"  Fiona felt fear ripple through her as Kyle suddenly spoke firmly, a flash of fire appearing around him, \"Then why don't you ask me?\"  The dwarf through the spear and it went through Kyle, clattering on the floor.  The necromancer rolled his eyes, \"I'm not actually here, idiot.\"  Igor sneered, \"You are an abomination!\"  \"I know.\" Kyle shrugged, \"But what choice did the Pact leave me?\"  Igor blinked, \"What?\"  \"You sent armies. Multiple. You tried to obliterate the College of History and Magic, from the face of the earth\u2026 You tried to kill the only two friends I have ever known\u2026\"1 Kyle glared at the dwarf, clenching his fists, \"You destroyed my home, came after my family, because of what I could be... Well, you made me into this!\"  Igor stared, \"You could have died.\"  Fiona stared from one to the other, \"The Pact butchered the College?\"  Kyle nodded, \"They emptied the Shadowlands... They sent vampires at a school, because they were scared of what a student might one day be... And you know, without that fear, I would never have invented the spell that allowed me to survive death... I became a monster... Because you, were far worse.\"  Igor sneered, raising his hands, muttering and Fiona glared at him, \"Do you really want to die? That isn't Kyle. It's a projection... He isn't here. He can't hurt you, and you can't hurt him. Only words matter... And yours are sorely lacking. What defence does the Pact have for itself?\"  The dwarf glared at her, \"Necromancy is one of the worst sins there is. The consequences for the entire world matter.\"  Kyle cocked his head, \"Fill me in. Let me know this secret knowledge, dwarf. Maybe I'll just go back to the Other Side.\"  Igor sighed heavily, \"The Other Side will come for you, when you don't pay. They will send an army of Reapers, creatures with their own magic, the ability to steal souls. They will devastate the entire world, hunting for you.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"I've struck my deal. The Reapers have no need to hunt me... I know when and where my soul will be destroyed, and I won't fight it.\"  Igor's eyes widened, \"You promised the Other Side your soul? Why?\"  \"To protect her!\" Kyle yelled, pointing at Fiona, \"Have you not been listening? You caused all this!\"  Igor shook his head, \"I do not believe it. I can't. Friendship is not worth so much.\"  Kyle clenched his fists, \"Truly? Then take a closer look at Fi. I had to save her from some of your vampire compatriots.\"  Igor glanced over at her, and Fiona swallowed nervously, the man sizing her up, \"What... What are you?\"  Fiona glared, \"The Elven Queen who owns the stone you are standing on.\"  \"... With fangs...\" Igor whispered, staring and Fiona's eyes widened, glancing over at Kyle, \"You... Saved me...\"  Kyle shrugged, \"From most of the hunger, from daylight... Not from turning. Sorry, haven't really had time to break the news gently.\"  Fiona clenched her fists together, \"Why? Because you've been off saving Abigail?\"  There was a snapping sound, and the world seemed to become freezing, as Fiona saw Igor freeze in place.  Kyle sighed heavily and sat down, \"We've got all the time in the world now, Fi.\"  She glared as she leaned against the wall, \"Never said you could call me that.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"What do you want from me, Fiona? I've barely been able to keep tabs on you and Abigail, let alone enough for us to sit and laugh about how bad a meal is... I can do stuff like freeze the world, like now, but it means I'll be weaker against whatever threat is currently rearing its head... I don't have a lot to give.\"  The elf glared at him, \"So? What? Am I supposed to forgive you for putting us all through this?\"  Kyle frowned, \"What would have happened if they killed me, Fiona? There were seven vampiric armies. Trolls and elves. The three human empires. All in one place... As much carnage and destruction as there was... It could have been so much worse... As it is, it's a fragile empire versus an ages old alliance. I'd say we have better odds at getting through this.\"  Fiona fought herself, understanding the politics and the machinations for war that had long been in the making. Kyle had simply been an excuse.  But she didn't want to accept that.  She wanted to be angry at him.  Kyle cocked his head, \"Fiona?\"  She glared at him, \"I'm annoyed. Can't you give a girl a break?\"  Kyle stood up slowly, \"You need to move, Fi... Something else is here.\"  Her eyes widened, and she threw herself across the floor, the window shattered, an elf standing up with a laugh.  He was male, tall, even for an elf. His black hair was tied in a neat ponytail, and in his hand, he held a scythe.  Kyle tensed, and yelled, \"Run, Fi!\"    Kyle stared at the elf, laughing and tossing his weapon from hand to hand.  \"What do you want, Reaper?\"  The elf cocked his head, his voice echoing darkly, \"Kyle Kilroy. Your debts are not yet due.\"  He clenched his fists, \"Why are you here, Reaper? If not for my soul, then what?\"  The elf rolled his eyes, \"The tallies are unbalanced. The elf owes the Other Side her life. Where once there was a queen, now there is a vampire. Unbound from every law or curse that was imposed upon that kind.\"  Kyle winced, \"Her debt is mine. I brought her back.\"  The elf shrugged, \"I am due a soul. I will Reap.\"  Kyle nodded slowly, \"Then reap mine.\"  \"I cannot. Though your debt is not due, it still exists. It will be taken.\"  Kyle winced, thinking as fast as he could, and he swallowed, \"Then I appeal.\"  The Reaper sneered, \"On what grounds?\"  \"Fiona Applesilver and Abigail Ignis are both bound to me... And the Other Side has placed an undue hold on Abigail.\" Kyle stated harshly, and the Reaper paused, \"Abigail Ignis has no hold on her.\"  Kyle glared, \"She did not die. The Reaper in her awoke, but she did not cross the threshold to the Other Side in death. She came close, but did not cross.\"  The Reaper paused, \"Your appeal will be heard... Others are needed. Look for our decision at dawn.\"  The elf vanished, fading as if he were a shadow.  Kyle breathed out a sigh of relief.    Abigail paused, staring at the figure as he stepped out of the ground, \"Now what?\"  The man's voice echoed, a deep rumble, \"Abigail Ignis.\"  She swallowed nervously, \"You're a Reaper?\"  The man blinked, staring at her, \"I... Am... But... Are you not?\"  She shrugged, \"That's what everyone keeps telling me.\"  The Reaper struggled for a moment, \"Then how is it that you are not channeling Messormancy? How is that you can enter the world of the living?\"  Abigail blinked, feeling the active curiosity in the man, and she swallowed, \"Just... Hold still... I have an... Idea.\"  The Reaper stiffened, but didn't run.  She put her hand on his chest, tingling as his life, emotions and memories washed over her. The hundreds of years since becoming a Reaper, bound to walk Limbo, and strike down the poor souls who imbalanced the world.  Abigail breathed in and out.  She focused carefully, forming a ball of Vitamancy, an incredibly complex shape, made from twisting overlapping strands into repeating octagonal shapes. As she formed it she smiled softly, \"It's nice to meet you, Braun.\"  A tear slipped down his cheek, \"I... Was... Braun...\"  Then she focused, steeling her will and pushing, the soul binding to the body below her grasp.  As she did she fell, tumbling away from the world into the void, but she had expected it, and stood solid, her scythe appearing in her hand as she growled, \"I am Death. I embrace it.\"  But this time it was no soul that streaked towards her. A headless cowl screamed at her, another scythe swiping towards her.  She struck it aside, surprised by the strength and ferocity as the spirit of the Reaper spun and went to tear her apart.  Abigail winced, noticing that with each blow the Reaper was knocking her backwards in this void without up or down. She growled, hissing, her scales standing on end, turning red, and fading to black, as her hair turned white, the will to destroy coursing through her like a river that feeds the ocean.  Abigail felt something vibrating in her chest, feeling more power than she could comprehend swamping over her, and she seized it, striking hard.  The Reaper tried to deflect her blow, but the scythe was sharpened by her rage, by the magic that flowed through her. As it curved towards the creature the wind was ripped asunder, forming wisps of the neverwhere.  Her blade cut through the weapon of her enemy, turning it to splinters as she tore the soul apart.  Abigail collapsed onto her knees, shaking, and she heard a thud, glancing up to see Braun lying on the cobblestone, twitching.  She hoped she had made the right decision.    Duke stared at the man shivering in the bed, and glanced at Abigail, \"You're sure he was a Reaper?\"  The nymph rolled her eyes, \"Yes. Totally. His voice echoed, and I saw his soul... And killed something that looked like a Reaper. It used a bloody scythe... I'm sure he was possessed by a Reaper.\"  Duke blinked, \"A theory, Miss Ignis?\"  Abigail shrugged, \"I don't know... I did to him, what I did to the ice golem... But instead of seeing his soul, I saw a spirit. I destroyed it.\"  Duke nodded slowly, \"So you believe the Reaper is not a part of you, but possesses you, in some active way.\"  Abigail shrugged, \"Braun could tell us more... He was surprised that I wasn't a permanent channel for... He called it Messormancy.\"  Duke nodded slowly, \"I do not know if he will survive... But I believe you may have defeated a Reaper, Miss Ignis.\"  Abigail winced, \"Professor... There's a... Problem...\"  He nodded slowly, \"I see a strand of white in your hair.\"  She winced, \"I think that'd be a symptom...\"  Duke glanced at her, \"Of what in particular?\"  Abigail ran a hand through her hair nervously, \"Braun was confused as to how I could pull back from the Reaper... And how I could cross into the world of the living... I think... I think I'm different. I don't feel like I have something in me... I feel like the Reaper is just another magic, halfway under my control.\"  Duke winced, \"How most Aimimancers feel... So... You think you are somehow different...?\"  Abigail shrugged, \"I feel like I'm Death.\"  Duke blinked slowly, considering, \"That... I can see why you hesitated.\"  The nymph glared at him, \"Thanks.\"  Duke sighed heavily, \"I do not mean to insult you, Miss Ignis\u2026 Feeling like an embodiment of the concept that is the end of life, is peculiar to most of the mundane peoples in this world. To those of us with power, it would force us to believe that we had stepped over the edge into insanity\u2026 But you do not feel that, and I do not believe it.\"  She looked at him sheepishly, \"Really?\"  Duke shrugged, \"Truly, I do\u2026 But we have more pressing matters\u2026 In my library, I once possessed a tome written in a dead language, that spoke of Merosean Magic\u2026 They share the root word and meaning, of Messormancy.\"  Abigail smiled grimly, \"You're office was destroyed, like everything else.\"  Duke nodded, \"But, we have options open to us\u2026 I gave up on traveling to the past, when I discovered that once observed, events cannot be changed\u2026 But I think that we should still be able to observe. See where the book ends up.\"  She shrugged, \"Awesome\u2026 So we're going back in time? \u2026 This is going to suck, isn't it?\"  Duke nodded, \"Indeed.\"    Fiona paused out of breath, and looked around herself fearfully, at all the elves frozen in place.  Some wore the looks of the everyday - happiness, stress, anger, and boredom.  Others didn't.  They were frozen in a moment of terror, a place of fear.  All around them, dwarves were leaping from rooftops, axes and maces in hand.  Their faces were different, stony, determined, and wrathful.  Fiona winced, fighting back an urge to tear them all limb from limb.  She knew there would be consequences to attacking whilst this place was frozen.  She just didn't know what.  Fiona ran a hand tough her hair, it wasn't just a desire to tear them apart, was it?  She wanted the destruction.  She wanted to see mangled flesh and blood pouring into the air.  She raised her hand delicately to her teeth, finding four fangs, that immediately cut her hand open.  She winced, staring at her hand as blood drops froze un the air as they separated from her, and a knew feeling washed over her.  She didn't just want destruction.  She had the power to do so, and it was right in front of her.  She touched a blood droplet softly, and pushed her will against it, forcing it to change shape.  Nothing happened.  Fiona let out a soft growl, trying to force it, and she saw the droplet begin to quiver, reality fighting for control.  \"Stop!\"  She spun around, blinking as colour washed back into the world, \"Kyle.\"  He clenched his fists, \"Seriously, Fiona? You want to learn Aimimancy?\"  She winced, \"I didn't! I don't think... I... Kyle what in the Shades happened to me? Back at the College?\"  He sighed heavily, shoulders drooping, \"You were dying. Throat slashed out by a vampire. Draco and Maidr were barely keeping you alive... And I finally managed to bring myself back fully... So I trashed the place. I took you to the infirmary, and pasted anyone in the way... Word spread I was back, and the fighting sort of eased off... I saved Abigail, and came back to you... But I couldn't heal you. I could find the vampire in you, like a parasite made of Aimimancy, wrapped around your lifeforce... The Vitamancy keeping you alive and the Aimimancy that was the vampire virus were nearly indistinguishable. Can't destroy one without the other, so I did the next best thing... I stopped you from dying, and fully awakening the vampire in you, and then I put a decent dozen protection spells on you, to remove the weaknesses of the vampire. Sunlight and so on.\"  Fiona stared him, \"I really am a vampire?\"  \"No.\" Kyle shook his head, \"You never died.\"  \"Why didn't you stop all this, Kyle?\" Fiona glared, tears welling in her eyes, \"You could have stopped it all, earlier!\"  Kyle sighed heavily, looking at the ground, \"I spent nearly a thousand years, looking for answers, Fiona... A way to save both you and Abigail. Some way, any way, to get you out of this situation... It took me that long to find a way.\"  Fiona glared, \"It's your fault we're in this! You started a bloody war!\"  Kyle nodded, \"I did... But the war was an excuse... A way to gather and bind a series of armies together... Something is coming, Fiona, something worse than anything I've done... I just wanted to see you alive at the other side of it.\"  Fiona frowned, \"What's coming?\"  He shook his head, \"If I tell you, then it is going to be worse. All of this.\"  \"I deserve to know, Kyle.\" Fiona growled, fighting an instinct to rip out his throat.  The young boy she had fallen in love with sighed heavily, and wiped a tear from his eye, \"Vampires come from somewhere... A particular place in the Shades... It's what sucked the Shades dry, destroyed the land... It's what is sustaining the ice age, the world over... It created the vampires as a way of spreading a disease, making inroads to spread it's influence.\"  Fiona frowned, \"What does that mean?\"  \"There's... There's a gateway to the Other Side in the Shades.\" Kyle said hesitantly, swallowing nervously, and he shrugged, \"There. I said it.\"  A shiver went through her entire body, and the elf queen swallowed, \"The..  Other Side?\"  Kyle smiled weakly, \"It's worse than you know.\"  Fiona shrugged, \"What do I know? Kyle? What does anyone but you and Professor Duke know about the Other Side?\"  Kyle shrugged, \"It's hard to describe... But think of vampires as the wild dogs, not the people that trained them, made them, and forged them from the souls they have stolen from the living world.\"  Fiona swallowed, \"Shades...\"  Kyle winced, \"It's complicated... Let's... Let's deal with the Bloodbound first... We'll need them too, if we hope to stop everyone.\"  Fiona winced, \"The Pact need to join a Necromancer, a vampiric queen, and an army of the dead against the Other Side? ... This is a crap day.\"  Kyle smiled, \"Kinda... But, I didn't freeze time.\"  She glanced over to the horizon, seeing a glimmer and grinned, \"You cheat, Kyle.\"  He shrugged, \"I'm not alone here. There's a certain leader outside the walls, I need you to negotiate with.\"  Fiona swallowed, \"Isaac Isaac? The troll leader you cursed?\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Yeah... He thought it best to destroy everything I love, which included you.\"  Her ears turned pink, and Fiona tried to seize the moment. She reached out to Kyle, wanting to grab him and pull him in for a kiss.  She forgot he was just a projection.  So instead, there was an awkward stumble.  Kyle blushed, \"Uh... We don't have much time. The Pact needs to be stopped.\"  Then he was.gone.    Shadows take his burning soul!  Kyle swore at himself, embarrassment, regret, and more complicated feelings washing over him.  He'd completely missed it.  He had known Fiona had liked him, and he'd flirted with her, but it wasn't that simple.  He didn't know what to think.  The world was in danger, he'd already sold his soul, everything was incredibly dangerous, at tipping point... But he couldn't get two girls out of his head.  Kyle yanked himself apart, reforming on a rooftop, looking at the scene as dwarves and elves fought, tearing each other apart, and he felt an incredible tiredness wash over him.  What was really the goal of all this?  What was the point?  \"About time.\" A deep voice.rumbled next to him, and Kyle spun, blinking, \"Professor Duke.\"  The old dryad shrugged, \"I am surprised you fought the depression for so long, Master Kilroy.\"  Kyle sighed heavily, \"Is there an army coming or not?\"  The dryad shook his head, \"I am not here for that. That will come later. For now, I am here to give you purpose again.\"  Kyle rolled his eyes, \"Truly.\"  The dryad glared at him, and Kyle felt the danger then. Danger he had not felt since dying.  Duke paused and shook his head, \"Things are accelerating. The other young girl you care so deeply for has destroyed the Reaper who challenged you here.\"  Kyle went white, \"Destroyed a Reaper? There's going to be hell to pay.\"  \"She destroyed the Reaper, not the man.\"  Duke's soft tones made Kyle jump, and he swallowed, \"Reapers are... An infection? A possessor?\"  Duke shrugged, \"Perhaps. There is not much more i can say... But in my quest to aid Miss Ignis, we will attempt to travel back before the College was destroyed. There is a book, which you once saw me studying, that mentions something akin to the magic Miss Ignis is discovering.\"  Kyle winced, \"I miss her.\"  Duke shrugged, \"You have already sold your soul, Kyle... You have denied any closeness with either of these wonderful women. The best you can do is keep them alive.\"  Kyle nodded slowly, \"Protect Abigail, please.\"  Duke shook his head, \"I will need protection, not her... She defeated a Reaper... I am no longer certain that she is just a Reaper... Perhaps, something more.\"  Kyle winced, \"How much do you know of Reapers, Professor? Are they just the foot soldiers in this war-to-be? Or the elite?\"  Duke glared, \"This war is here, Kilroy. It was here long before your birth. I established the Silvergate clan to protect the borders. I established the Applesilver family to ensure the Pact would never again interfere. I founded the College of History and Magic, along with seven others, so we could forge an army in this world!\"  The vehemence of the anger hit Kyle, but more, it was how long Duke had been fighting.  Kyle winced, \"I didn't mean to start all this.\"  Duke shrugged, \"But you did... It was your attitude, Kyle... Until you, a Necromancer was a creature of patience, of tact. Predictable. Then along comes a young brash Aimimancer, and he delves so quickly and deeply into a new magic that he must be eliminated. Not only that, he shows a large amount of unpredictability. Able to forge new spells with the least amount of thought, ingenious in the way he finds more power... The Other Side is right to be terrified of you.\"  Kyle nodded slowly, \"Not yet, they aren't.\"  Duke creaked as he leaned forward, \"If you aren't careful Kyle, you will tip the balance of favour in our enemy's direction.\"  Kyle sighed heavily, \"I met her, Professor.\"  Duke stepped backwards hurriedly, \"You met the Lady?\"  Kyle shrugged, \"That is with whom I made my deal. Not with one of the court, but with her.\"  Duke shook his head, \"The others can be reasoned with... But her will is iron... Why?\"  Kyle smiled tightly, \"The others would take back their power if they see me make a single move against them. She... Would not. She would allow me to face her with her own strength.\"  Duke shook his head, \"But... To even speak with her... Is insanity.\"  Kyle winced, \"I saw her face Duke... And you need to know.\"  Duke frowned, \"I am surprised you were allowed to return to the world of the living.\"  Kyle shook his head, \"Not the point... Duke, she was a nymph.\"  The professor stared at Kyle for a long time and then nodded slowly, \"You believe she and Abigail are connected? That Abigail is not a mere Reaper, but connected to their Queen?\"  Kyle shrugged, \"It's only your doubts that Abigail is just a Reaper that sparked the thought.\"  Duke frowned, \"We will tread carefully.\"  Kyle clenched a fist, \"If you fail to protect her, Duke, I will destroy you.\"  The old Necromancer looked at the young, struggling not to laugh.  Kyle sneered, \"The deal for my soul, professor, was a kiss.\"  Duke froze, staring at Kyle, \"The Lady would kiss one of your choosing?\"  He shrugged, \"I intended it for myself, once all this is over... But I would gladly make it yours if you do not protect Abigail.\"  The professor shrugged, \"So be it.\"  Kyle smiled and turned, dismissing the professor's projection with more force than Duke would have thought possible.  His attention snapped to the task at hand, and a ring of flames sprang up around him, racing in a circle.  Next the edge of the roof was torn away, the stone floating upwards and became a ring around him.  Above those two rings, a third formed, around his head height. The wind whipped itself, becoming a visible vortex.  Kyle smiled.grimly as he saw the world beginning to move, the sky beginning to swirl overhead, and he stretched out a hand, the trees in the plaza below exploding, water flying upwards and formed another spinning circle above him.  Finally, Kyle took a blade from his pocket and cut his hand, the blood flying upwards and forming it's own circle.  Kyle glared at the world, as the sky turned black, rain beginning to pour down. He spoke, his voice amplified, \"I am Kyle Kilroy. If any dare face me, do so now.\"  The fighting slowed and then stopped as each dwarf and elf.turned to face him.  Kyle clenched a fist, the circles sprang outwards, encompassing the entire city, and he floated upwards to the center.  He glared down, \"The Pact believes what I am to be an abomination. They mean to destroy this city, and what I care for... But this city is protected.\"  A dwarven commander hefted his axe and then tossed it, the blade flying towards Kyle.  He felt.shock hit him.  He recognized the enchantment on the weapon.  This is how he had died the first time.  Fear and agony washed over him.  He couldn't think.  He couldn't move.  The axe flew closer.    Isaac Isaac burst through the stone wall, barely pausing before plowing through the army in his wake, his hand grabbing the small weapon out of the air and crushing it.  He dropped it to the ground, glaring, \"I be Isaac Isaac. I lead Trolls. This man mine to kill.\"  The dwarves slowly backed away, and Isaac Isaac began to think something was different. Wrong.  Had he hurt himself?  He looked at his hand, but it was intact. Fine.  He felt a human hand touch his shoulder and glared at Kyle, who smiled softly, \"They're waiting for you to die. The blade was cursed in the same way they first killed me.\"  Isaac Isaac paused, \"And I not dead why?\"  Kyle smiled, \"Trolls may turn to stone in sunlight... But no troll can be harmed by magic. Moved, yes. Harmed... No.\"  The troll leader smiled slowly, \"Kyle Kilroy is an enemy of my enemy. Friend.\"  Kyle stared, \"You would forgive me?\"  Isaac Isaac shook his head, \"I will make a meal of your bones... But maybe when you died of old age.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Good enough... Now, um... The Bloodbound Pact...\"  Isaac Isaac looked down, wincing as he saw dwarves with swords, axes and shields. Glaring at him, and preparing.  He smiled, \"Troll Hoarde ten minutes out.\"  Kyle winced, \"My army is half a day out.\"  Isaac Isaac clenched his fists, and spoke loudly, \"Little elves!\"  He paused, revolted, \"Little elves... Trolls will forgive all, if together we defeat Pact.\"  A clear strong voice spoke from a nearby rooftop, her voice nearly musical, \"As Queen of the elves... I accept.\"  Then everything erupted into movement.  Isaac Isaac roared as blade bit into his skin, his fists were in constant movement. Beating and bludgeoning.  The ground beneath him was turning black, his hands were cracked and weary.  Blood poured down his back, his arms.  He was being torn to pieces by an army of undergrounders. Isaac Isaac let loose a roar.  His voice filled the air.  It was the sound of agony.  The sound of pain.  The sound of fear.  It was... The sound of... Sadness... True deep hurt, inside...   He knew it as he roared.  It was the sound of grief.  There was a resounding thunderclap, and for a moment, his attackers fell backwards, burned and beaten.  Kyle appeared in front of him, and the handle of a sword grew out of the ground. Then Kilroy was gone.  Isaac Isaac seized the handle, finding with astonishment that it fit his hand perfectly, and he drew it up.  The silver blade glistened in the rain, reflecting the fires all around.  Isaac Isaac smiled as he raised it against his enemies.  He would call the sword,  War .    Fiona fell backwards, the stone around her arm shattering to dust.  The dwarf sneered at her, his fingers flexing, \"No elf is better with stone that a dwarf.\"  Fiona glared at the mancer, her fists tensing, \"I think you'd be surprised.\"  She didn't get a moment to show off, however, as the dwarf burst into flames.  She leaped to her feet, and off the rooftop. As she hit the ground it yanked upwards, molding to her body with a mutter.  She punched, shattering the face of a surprised axe-wielding opponent.  Fiona spun, idly blocking a blow, and stared at the storm that was Kyle.  There had to be ten thousand dwarves swarming over the capital, and half of them were focused on one man.  She could see him, suspended in the air, made of fire, surrounded by stone and wind.  Kyle was beating back nearly a thousand soldiers, but all the same... She couldn't help feeling that he was losing.  How could they win this fight?  If he couldn't?  Fiona felt rage and fear boiling up inside her.  She had to stop the Pact here, there was too much at stake.  She didn't care that Kyle thought they would need them, they had to be stopped.  Her hands reached down and touched the soft soil, a shell forming over her, releasing her into her own cave.  Fiona was left in the dark as blades clanged, elves screamed and trolls roared.  She touched the soft dirt, taking in it's scent, trying to understand it.  Her will hardened, becoming iron.  Fiona gripped the earth, magic flowing through her like she was a waterfall, and she spoke quietly.  Her voice was firm, unable to be questioned, as her authority echoed.   \"Videte nunc, exaudi clamorem meum, exaudi vocem meum.\nHeed me now, heed my cry, listen to my voice.\"  The ground beneath her began to shake, each particle responding in kind to her command.  Fiona felt the shell that was her cave begin to shake, her attackers trying to get to her, and destroy her.  \"Liga mihi, ligaveris super terram, usque perpetuum addicere.\nBind to me, bind to the earth, bind to forever.\"  Sweat began to pour off her face, dripping to the ground, as she focused.  Most spells were simply eight Latin words with strong conviction behind them, different emotions for different magics.  Repeating the phrase in English doubled the power of the spell, but also the wear and tear on the caster, in many cases ending in death as the spell collapses before being finished.  Fiona had only known one man insane enough to bind several of those doubly-powerful phrases together\u2026 But what she was trying to do had never been done.  It was raw, powerful and entirely insane.  She smiled, Kyle must be rubbing off on her.  \"Eaque militia let stare test temporis, in perpetuum.\nLet this spell stand the test of time, in perpetuum.\"  The ground was alive, every particle around her lit up with magic, waiting to be used\u2026 Begging.  Fiona winced, thinking on her words.  The words mattered\u2026 The eloquence leant its own power\u2026 She couldn't fight the feeling that Kyle would be able to do this better.  But he didn't have the will.  He wouldn't do what needed to be done.  So it was in her hands.  \"Accipite regnum, accipe en elvish terrarum, mihi devincire.\nTake this kingdom, take the elvish lands, bind them to me.\"  Blinding agony shot through her, and Fiona gasped, struggling.  It felt like a knife had burst through her heart.  She couldn't concentrate, couldn't focus.  It hurt. It hurt. It hurt.  Fiona let out a yell of anger, fighting the magic burning her for control, but finding little more than a slippery staircase.  This was too much, it was burning her out, overwhelming her before she was done.  She wasn't fighting a losing battle, it was already lost.  Words tumbled from her mouth, weak, pathetic, but binding to the source of magic that was the remnants of an elvish princess.  \"De terra illius regni, ut ligaretur pannis sanguine.\u000bFrom the earth of this kingdom, bind it my blood.\"  The magic shifted focus, the vibrations of the world around her changed.  The pitch was different, the frequency was alien, and relief from the pain poured down upon her.  Before Fiona could breathe a sigh of relief, a sense of nausea struck her, and she couldn't hold back.  Vomit pooled around her feet, the stench filling the small cavity she was hiding in.  She felt her face crinkle in disgust, but she was far from done.  \"Sanguis en regnum tumultus. Tumultus terra mea.\nBind the kingdom to my blood. Bind the earth to my command.\"  Fiona felt like she'd just been round-house kicked in the face whilst a vampire attempted to suck the soul from her battered body.  She collapsed onto her knees involuntarily, gagging as she did.  It just had to be vomit, didn't it?  Couldn't be flowers or something actually pleasant.  She smiled grimly.  Only two more commands, that's all she had to do\u2026 Then she would have cast the most powerful spell in the history of magic.  Her mind was spent, the magic made her feel like she was slowly dissolving into the air, and she had no clue how the battle was raging around her.  But it didn't matter.  Only one thing mattered now.  Finishing the spell.  \"Amove lamia, nani et proditores regni, contere eos.\nRemove all vampires, dwarves and traitors from this kingdom, destroy them.\"  Fiona had intended to keep going, to finish the spell as quickly as she could.  She found herself instead on hands and knees, coughing violently, blood splattering on the ground.  Her hands turned to claws in the soil, and she felt her forehead touch it.  She must be bent over in a ball, gasping for air as she was killed by the magic she was channelling.  It didn't matter.  She could die later.  \"Exilio\u2026 membra\u2026 Sangui\u2026nis\u2026cursu\u2026 Foederis\u2026 dryadales\u2026 et\u2026 a\u2026 solo\u2026\nExile\u2026 all\u2026 members\u2026 of the\u2026 Blood\u2026bound\u2026 Pact\u2026 from\u2026 elvish\u2026 soil!\"  The last word became a shout, as the spell hardened and launched into effect.  The magic fled, the ground shook, as the magic sort to obey it's command.  Fiona fell sideways to the ground.",

            "text": "Chapter Seventeen\n\n\n\n\nAbigail's steps were silent as she crept around the corners of the familiar hallways, desperately trying to ignore the statues that would turn and stare at her.\n\n\nDuke didn't creep.\n\n\nHe strode, proud and sure in the knowledge that once observed, the past could not be changed.\n\n\nThey were just ghosts in the fog.\n\n\nCloudwalkers moving through memories.\n\n\nAbigail struggled with that concept when everyone could see and interact with her.\n\n\nThey reached Duke's cold and dark office, with its door of living oak, and he banged loudly on it.\n\n\nThe door swung open, and Abigail winced as she saw Duke looking at Duke.\n\n\nThe one behind the desk laughed, \"Truly? You needed to return to me? What piece of knowledge have we forgotten?\"\n\n\nThe Duke that had come with her shrugged, \"What does it matter what I say, you will not recall it.\"\n\n\nThe Duke behind the table stood, his hands slamming down onto the table, but as they did they become a moving torrent of black liquid, moving towards them.\n\n\nDuke slammed the door closed, and spun to Abigail, \"Run!\"\n\n\nShe found more magic in his statement than mere command, and found herself halfway down the hall before she could ask why.\n\n\nThe young nymph streaked down the hallways, wishing she had some level of control of her magic.\n\n\nWhat use was she?\n\n\nA stone hand jerked her to a stop, and Abigail spun.\n\n\nThe face of a statue stared into her, black liquid pouring from an empty visor.\n\n\nAbigail cursed and tried to jerk away, but it was pathetic.\n\n\nIn instinct she reached out for Vitamancy, but felt nothing.\n\n\nHer magic was gone.\n\n\nAbigail clenched her fists, \"What do you want with me?\"\n\n\nThe possessed statue fell to its knees bowing till its head touched the ground.\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"Say what?\"\n\n\nIt looked up at her and spoke.\n\n\nThe walls shook, stone fell from the ceilings, and Abigail felt herself fill with the uncontrolled magic she was beginning to grasp.\n\n\nShe felt her hair whip into a frenzy around her face, saw it streak to white in a moment.\n\n\n\"We are honored to be in your presence.\"\n\n\nAbigail sighed, and then heard something like metal strike the floor beside her, and she was winced as she saw the scythe in her hand.\n\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\nThe statue trembled in fear, \"We are the forgotten, the ones you cursed to wander the unchangeable memories of the past.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"And you decided to attack passersby by yourself, did you?\"\n\n\nThe statue crumpled, forming a ball, as the voice reduced to a whisper, \"We were lost. We thought your rage would never end.\"\n\n\nAbigail crouched, \"I've go news for you, dude. I am not Death.\"\n\n\nThe statue unfurled slowly, \"You are... I remember your face...\"\n\n\nIt paused, a trembling stone hand brushing her cheek, \"Yet... It was set hard with years of rage and destruction... It has been softened by happiness and... Love?\"\n\n\nAbigail's heart jumped a beat as Kyle's face loomed in her mind. She smiled sweetly and took the stone hand, \"What crime did you commit?\"\n\n\nThe statue laughed, \"We dared to offer you our soul in exchange for power... We did not offer it to you direct... A member of your court.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"And they would be?\"\n\n\n\"War, Wrath, Sin, and Judgement.\" The statue stared at her, \"Have you forgotten all? Become a nymph to understand your enemy?\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"I nearly died... Ever since, I have had this magic... Usually in the presence of... Well, I was kinda taught to call you... Abominations.\"\n\n\nThe statue laughed as it stood, \"The Lady of the Dark, the Queen of the Dead, reduced to a little nymph... Lost in a land of those who hate her...\"\n\n\nAbigail spun the scythe, feeling the air tear apart, her vision sharpening, and she clenched a fist, \"If you want a fight, you have one.\"\n\n\nThe creature backed away, bowing low, \"Sorry, little nymph... There are many more of us... Than you and your little scythe.\"\n\n\nShe winced as the walls began to bleed, a thick black liquid creeping down, and Abigail knew she had picked the wrong fight.\n\n\nShe felt the scythe in her hand, the power it held.\n\n\nShe felt the air moving around her in a torrent, looking at her white hair being tossed about.\n\n\nSo be it.\n\n\nIf they called her Death, so she would be, and her hand would strike down like the hammer of the old gods.\n\n\nAbigail embraced the rage, feeling her scales flickering in the air, seeing them change from a light blue to the blackest night.\n\n\nShe glared around, her scythe feeling like an extension of herself, and she felt her throat begin to vibrate.\n\n\nShe spoke, her voice echoing, the hidden strength in it threatening to tear the building apart, \"For crimes against your Queen, I sentence you to the Void.\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"Come get your relief.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuke was thrown against a wall, black tentacles encircling each of his roots, and he stared down at a bastardised form of himself.\n\n\nThe creature laughed, \"How did you do it, Adrian? Convince the Black Queen to forgive your debt?\"\n\n\nDuke winced, \"So she truly is the Lady?\"\n\n\nThe shadow shrugged, \"We believe so... Not that it will matter.\"\n\n\nIt picked up a book from a nearby table, \"A fascinating read, professor. It is the reason we decided to stay here. Guard it's secrets.\"\n\n\nDuke clenched his fists, struggling to find any purchase on magic.\n\n\nThe shadow shrugged, \"But then... We would know it's power, wouldn't we? We are the Merose, after all.\"\n\n\nDuke winced, \"I don't want to control the Merose.\"\n\n\nThe shadow inside his past shrugged, \"No, you want to control the one who cursed us. Put us here... But we don't want that. She has offered us respite. Oblivion... For that... We welcome her.\"\n\n\nDuke felt a chill run down his back, what had he done?\n\n\nBringing Abigail here had been a mistake.\n\n\nThere was a flash of fire, and Duke collapsed coughing to the ground.\n\n\nHe looked up, pausing as he saw Kyle.\n\n\nHis body was battered, his hair was singed. His clothes were little more than rags, but it was the young man's eyes that were the most telling.\n\n\nThey were red, puffy, and empty.\n\n\nDuke winced, \"Kyle?\"\n\n\nThe young man clenched a fist and Duke was flung through the wall behind him.\n\n\nHe groaned, glancing up as Kyle walked over the rubble, \"I told you to protect her, Duke. I will not lose her as well.\"\n\n\nDuke cringed, \"Fiona's dead?\"\n\n\nKyle stumbled, nearly collapsing, unable to speak, tears running down his cheeks. He nodded almost imperceptibly.\n\n\nDuke stood up, \"How... You could bring her back.\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"No... No I can't. She doesn't want to be brought back... She cursed her kingdom. All members of the Pact, dwarves and... Traitors... Can no longer set foot there.\"\n\n\nDuke winced, \"And you are a traitor to the Other Side.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, and Duke shrugged, \"Then break her spell.\"\n\n\nThe young man glared, \"You think I haven't tried? She made a aimimantic spell of eight verses, using dual reflection. I only know of one stronger, and it was used to make the gateway to the Other Side in the Shades!\"\n\n\nDuke winced, \"I am so sorry, Kyle.\"\n\n\nThe young man turned, \"Let's go get Abigail.\"\n\n\n\"She's not the one in danger, Kyle... The Merose thought she was the Lady, and that seals it for me. She is.\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, and then vanished.\n\n\nDuke sighed heavily.\n\n\nHe'd tried to teach Kyle, but now... He pitied the living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail slammed the butt of her scythe into the ground and the black liquid attempting to wash over her was shoved away, and she was left in a bubble of air, as the liquid lay frozen, washing above her in a frozen wave.\n\n\nShe felt something dark rising up in her, and she was tempted to obliterate it all, right now, in the moment.\n\n\nDestroy them all.\n\n\nIt would be easy.\n\n\n\"Neat trick, care to teach me it?\"\n\n\nAbigail's hair dropped as the wind vanished, the scythe evaporated in her hand.\n\n\nShe turned and stared at Kyle through a frizzy mass of hair and instantly blushed, \"Hey.\"\n\n\nHe shook his head, and she saw the sadness.\n\n\nShe held out her hand, \"Show me.\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"Not like this... Not right now.\"\n\n\nHer voice echoed with power as she shouted, \"Show me!\"\n\n\nKyle stumbled, and winced, \"What in the Shades is happening to you, Abigail?\"\n\n\nShe collapsed onto her knees, clutching her head, gently rocking. \"It's all wrong, it's all wrong.\"\n\n\nKyle crouched in front of her, \"Then let's go home.\"\n\n\nShe didn't get a chance to argue.\n\n\nThey were simply back in the ruins, no more freaky black liquid attacking her, no more memories of war. No more soul of evil.\n\n\nAbigail stared at the ground, \"You must hate me, Kyle.\"\n\n\nShe heard him make a sound of astonishment, and she shrugged, \"If it wasn't for me, you'd be with Fi, and she'd be safe.\"\n\n\nKyle sighed heavily, \"Fi... Fi went so that everyone else would have a chance. I couldn't stop her, I could barely help defend her.\"\n\n\nAbigail felt tears rolling down her face, her scales fading back to blue, and she shrugged, \"If I wasn't in the way, you could have saved her... Back when this all started... It all would have been better if you never met me.\"\n\n\nKyle stared at her in shock, and Abigail looked down at the ground, guilt overwhelming her.\n\n\nIt was all her fault.\n\n\nA calloused hand touched her cheek softly, and she looked up in surprise, tears running down her face, and she saw him smile at her, through the grief and stains of war.\n\n\nHe leaned in, his forehead touching hers, as she felt his emotions begin to flood over her.\n\n\nRegret.\n\n\nIsaac Isaac stood there, roaring, an enormous sword in his hand as he cut a swathe through his enemies.\n\n\nThe troll king stood, sword in hand, as the sun crept over the horizon.\n\n\nHe screamed in rage as his body turned to stone.\n\n\nAs the statue became complete, hammers struck hard, and he crumbled to dust.\n\n\nExhaustion.\n\n\nKyle flew above the world, rings of fire, stone and wind striking the ground.\n\n\nA shield surrounded a nearby boulder, bound with Aimimancy, sucking him dry.\n\n\nHis grip on the magic keeping him in the air faltered, and he very nearly fell to his own death, barely clawing back on some hidden reserve of energy.\n\n\nHatred.\n\n\nA dwarf laughed loudly, his hammer channeling lightning as he struck down those around him.\n\n\n\"About time we made the elves extinct, isn't it boys?\"\n\n\nGrief.\n\n\nThe boulder cracked open, a burst of blood shot into the air, and Kyle gasped as he felt the Aimimancy snapping into place, changing the world.\n\n\nHe had a fleeting glance of the disfigured pulp of bone and blood, that had once been Fiona.\n\n\nThen he was gone.\n\n\nTears ran down Abigail's face as she breathed in Kyle's scent, and then a calloused hand took her chin gently between two fingers and raised her head.\n\n\nButterflies filled her stomach, as she stared into his eyes.\n\n\nConfusion filled her head, her emotions were all over the place, and she didn't dare to trust her own muddled thoughts.\n\n\nShe didn't have to.\n\n\nHer lips met his, as all around her danced the memories of Kyle's past.\n\n\nArmies rose and died, as he held her in his arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraco looked over as a wall was shattered to pieces, a dozen stone soldiers looking directly at him, and he frowned, \"The heir of the College has already been found... What do you want with me?\"\n\n\n\"Fiona Applesilver is dead.\" A voice reverberated through his soul, and his eyes widened, fear itching up his spine.\n\n\nDraco stared at them, \"And so you have chosen me?\"\n\n\nThe statue inclined his head slightly, and Draco grimaced, \"Bar the gates. Rebuild the walls. The College is to prepare for war.\"\n\n\nHe spun around, pausing as he saw a young man, his eyes bloodshot, standing behind him.\n\n\n\"What war?\"\n\n\nBellum winced, \"You lost against the Pact. If you lost Fiona... They won.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled grimly, \"She banished us. The Elven kingdom is a stronghold against the dangers of this world, now.\"\n\n\nBellum winced, \"So the Pact will come here next. We need to prepare.\"\n\n\nKyle clenched a fist, and Draco screamed as he felt the blood.in his veins boil. He stared up at what had once been nothing more than a young student.\n\n\nKyle stood over him, \"There is so... Little... Stopping me sending you back to the Other Side... Did you know what?\"\n\n\nDraco forced himself to his feet, relying on the fabled strength of his ancestors, \"I will stop you, if necessary, Master Kilroy.\"\n\n\nKyle rolled his eyes, and the pain vanished. \"We're not on equal ground, Headmaster... We were once... But it was a brief moment when a show of power could intimidate a young boy.\"\n\n\nDraco smiled weakly, \"Seems you learned that lesson well.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"I don't want you to prepare for war, Headmaster. War means you get to fight back. Drive an enemy out into the open and cut them down.\"\n\n\nDraco frowned, \"The College is being restored, Kyle. Careful about commanding its Headmaster.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled softly, \"I want you to defend something for me, Headmaster... If you fail... I will not fail to end this world.\"\n\n\nDraco felt a chill run down his spine, \"Miss Ignis.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"You'll find her... Difficult... But I need to end what I have started. If that means I go alone and buy everyone some more time... So be it.\"\n\n\nDraco winced, \"You plan on taking the Shades by yourself?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"What choice do I have? Fiona is dead. Isaac Isaac is dead. Balta, Malata and New Rome are still infighting about who their next generals should be, and if they truly are bound to the Draco Charter.\"\n\n\nDraco.winced, \"There are seven other magical establishments in this world. Seek help from them.\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"They are the only reason you and I can still talk. After the Silvergate clan were butchered, they were the ones who rushed to protect the border... And others are busy with the Bloodbound Pact... I don't see any other solutions, Draco.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster shook his head slowly, \"You are still just a student of Necromancy, Kyle. How do you expect to fight the creators of it?\"\n\n\nHe grinned, \"They don't use Necromancy, Headmaster. They use Messormancy, channeled from its source, the Lady Death.\"\n\n\nDraco winced, \"Don't say her name.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"What of it? I've seen her face, Draco.\"\n\n\nThe half-dragon took a step backwards, \"I always wished that she and her court were just fairy tales.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Unfortunately, they're the ones trying to kill half this world, and keep it so. The living should never be allowed to outnumber the dead.\"\n\n\nDraco shook his head, \"The Lady is the source of almost all magic... How can we survive this? How can you imagine that you could fight her?\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"I've already dealt my hand. Time will tell if I can get through this... Just... Keep Abigail safe. Without her, I won't need to destroy the world.\"\n\n\nDraco nodded gravely, \"Fine. Where is she?\"\n\n\nKyle laughed and vanished.\n\n\nDraco turned around and couldn't help staring.\n\n\nThe nymph was standing nearby, one hand on a broken wall, staring at the horizon.\n\n\nHer scales were visible, her glamour gone. They were black, the edges tinged with red.\n\n\nHer hair was black, with streaks of white, including her fringe.\n\n\nBut what truly made him fear, was the scythe sitting in her other hand.\n\n\nShe sighed heavily, \"Tell me, Headmaster, have you ever met a Reaper?\"\n\n\nHe winced, \"No, they have no business with the living.\"\n\n\nShe turned around, her eyes glowing, a brilliant blue. \"I am not a Reaper. I reap those who reap the dead.\"\n\n\nDraco shivered, and then another figure entered the room slowly, an Elven man, and he smiled softly, \"And I will reap for you again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandice froze as the world around her grew dark. She muttered a spell, holding a fireball at the ready.\n\n\nLaughter echoed around her.\n\n\nShe felt her anger, coaxing it, growing it to overcome the terror burning through her.\n\n\nShe ground her teeth, waiting impatiently.\n\n\nBut they liked to play with their food.\n\n\nMake it scream and run, and just as you thought you might be able to escape, they'd swoop in and tear out your heart.\n\n\nA swarm of flies appeared nearby, reassembling into a man. He smiled grimly, never glancing towards her. He clenched a fist, and then spoke, \"Annoying, aren't they, Candice? Taunting when they know they can't touch you.\"\n\n\nShe glared over at him, \"Oh really, Kyle? And why would that be? Because you're my night in shining armor?\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"Because of the Draco Charter. Every vampire in this world is bound by it, and the Lady has ratified it.\"\n\n\nThe swarm vanished, and they were left standing on snowy planes, alone.\n\n\nKyle turned towards her, \"What are you doing out here?\"\n\n\nShe.sneered, \"I'm a Silvergate, Kyle. I won't ignore them anymore, even if you are.\"\n\n\nHe sighed heavily, weariness rolling off him like a waterfall, \"Candice... You're the last of your bloodline. Fiona died defending the Elvish Kingdom from the Bloodbound Pact.\"\n\n\nShe frowned, processing it slowly, \"The Bloodbound want you gone.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"They be about to get their wish.\"\n\n\nCandice blinked, \"You're headed to the Shades.\"\n\n\nHe nodded grimly, and she glanced around, \"You and what army?\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"I left my army at the College of History and Magic. I'm hoping that enough remnants of the other colleges still exist by the time I get to the Shades.\"\n\n\nCandice sneered, \"You travelled to the Elven Kingdom quick enough. Why not do that again? Why are you here?\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"You know the secret of the Shades, Candice... You know the Gateway there. I can't pet them know I'm coming... If I do, then they will be ready for me.\"\n\n\nShe shivered, despite herself, \"I've only seen the Gateway once, at my initiation... There's no way you could hope to get close. It's not guarded by hungry vampires, it has its own army. We call them -\"\n\n\n\"- Reapers.\" Kyle finished, and nodded, \"I know... Did you hear what Abigail did before you left?\"\n\n\nCandice stared, \"You really think she managed to cure a Reaper?\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"No... She just gave him back his free will. He's guarding her now.\"\n\n\nCandice scratched her head, \"You have a Reaper, and a Reaper-killer on your side. Why in the Shades are you leaving them behind?\"\n\n\n\"You can't fight the Lady, Candice.\" Kyle sighed, shaking his head, \"No matter what you do... She comes for you in the end... I'm not going to fight them. I'm just going to stop them.\"\n\n\nCandice felt her fury hit tipping point and the fireball launched towards him, growing to the size of a house before it hit him.\n\n\nThe fireball seemed to crash over him, and then it righted.\n\n\nKyle stood there, engulfed, \"Tell me, young Silvergate, is it only anger that can fuel Pyromancy?\"\n\n\nShe swallowed nervously, remembering her attacks on Fiona, \"Hatred works just as well.\"\n\n\nThe flames vanished and Kyle sighed, \"How about hating yourself?\"\n\n\nShe paused, surprised, \"I... Wouldn't know.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled, his eyes not quite touching it, \"No. You wouldn't. But you do know the Shades, and if I need to sneak up on anyone, it would need to be a Silvergate to guide me.\"\n\n\nCandice paused, \"Instead of taking on the Shades by yourself... You want me to help you out?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"I've had worse ideas.\"\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes, \"Not by much... Come on, it'll take a week and a half.to get there.\"\n\n\nKyle rolled his eyes, \"I wasn't walking there.\"\n\n\nCandice frowned, \"Then how? No magic, remember?\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"No big or loud magic... Ever wanted to be able.to fly like a vamp?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBraun sat down in a chair carefully, letting out a long sigh of satisfaction.\n\n\nAbigail's hands touched his shoulders, \"Getting comfortable are we?\"\n\n\nHe shot to his feet, surprised when she laughingly pushed him back into the chair, \"Relax, we aren't needed anywhere just yet.\"\n\n\nBraun winced, \"Sorry... I haven't sat since... I died.\"\n\n\nAbigail blinked, \"She that much of a bitch?\"\n\n\nBraun shook his head, \"It's not that... The dead don't sleep... We have no time to relax.\"\n\n\n\"But she sits on a big throne, doesn't she?\" Abigail asked, injustice ringing in her voice.\n\n\nBraun shook his head, \"We rarely see our Queen... She maintains the Gateway to this realm, gives the Reapers their power,  oversees all of us... She maintains the Other Side, ensuring it doesn't just fall apart.\"\n\n\nAbigail frowned, \"The Other Side could fall apart?\"\n\n\nBraun smiled sheepishly, \"It's artificial. Shouldn't exist. The Lady created it, so that when people died, they shouldn't have to suffer as she did in life.\"\n\n\nAbigail rolled her eyes, \"Dude. I wasn't brought up on your fairy tales. What suffering?\"\n\n\nBraun shrugged, \"Something typical, I guess. Her lover fought in a war and died. Necromancy was impossible. She would never see him again, so she built a place where the dead would go, so that you could be reunited, never.to be separated again.\"\n\n\nAbigail scratched her head, \"That sounds like a good thing. All sweet and cute... The Other Side is trying to destroy this world.\"\n\n\nBraun shook his head, \"Not destroy. Absorb. No more death, no more pain. Utopia. At least, that's how War and Disaster try and sell it.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled, \"So... The Court of the Lady, they kind of rule in her stead?\"\n\n\nBraun nodded, \"Yeah.\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"Tell me more. Everything. Who are they? What is the Other Side like?\"\n\n\nBraun smiled softly, \"You've never been?\"\n\n\n\"I got stuck in Limbo for a week, and I went.to a place like a void... But it was bad.\" Abigail trailed off.\n\n\nBraun swallowed, \"You went to the Clearing House. It's where.criminals are stripped of their immortality, and left to kill each other.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"That's just plain nasty.\"\n\n\nBraun shrugged, \"It's either that or the Reapers eat your soul... And you become one of us.\"\n\n\nAbigail scratched her chin, \"Are you the first free Reaper?\"\n\n\nBraun shrugged, \"Maybe... May the first Reapers were free. Who knows? I'd guess a Reaper once got sent to the Clearing House, and the Lady didn't want to risk it ever again.\"\n\n\nAbigail smiled, \"I need to see her.\"\n\n\nBraun launched himself backwards out of the chair, scythe appearing in hand, \"Are you insane?\"\n\n\nAbigail's blue scales faded to black, highlighting her eyes and hair, \"Do you think I'm insane?\"\n\n\nBraun winced, \"You don't want to walk in there. The only way out, for the living, is by dying. By making a deal with a member of the court, to return.\"\n\n\nAbigail laughed, her scales fading back to blue, and then to her white skin, \"Kyle made a deal with your Queen to protect me.\"\n\n\nBraun scratched his head, \"Are you sure? I didn't get the memo.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"Oh no... Do you think it possible... That someone like War has... Usurped her?\"\n\n\nBraun cringed, \"That's not... Possible.\"\n\n\nAbigail raised an eyebrow, \"Really?\"\n\n\nBraun sighed heavily, \"Discord has tried once or twice. But he was helping our Queen. Leading the invasion.\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"So, it's possible. That Death isn't the bad guy here. She might just be a pawn, or figure head.\"\n\n\nBraun burst out laughing, \"Our Queen? A pawn? She handbuilt another realm! Do you truly think anyone could control her?\"\n\n\nAbigail's face clouded, \"You'd be surprised what people would do for the sake of love, family, and their own adulation.\"\n\n\nBraun cocked his head, \"Speaking from experience?\"\n\n\nShe shook her head slowly, but for a moment her glamor collapsed, revealing the nymph beneath.\n\n\nBraun ran a hand through his hair, and then sighed with relief as another figure entered the room.\n\n\nThe dryad cracked as he shrugged, \"So, Abigail, is this creature helpful to us?\"\n\n\nBraun glared at him, \"I'm right here, Necromancer.\"\n\n\nThe dryad glanced at him, \"A fact I am painfully aware of, young elf.\"\n\n\nBraun paused, \"You think you're older than me? Really?\"\n\n\nThe dryad laughed, \"You trained at the College of Pyromancy, nearly a thousand years ago, you impetuous twerp.\"\n\n\nBraun started as memories flooded his mind, but most distinct was an old dryad, who had helped to found the College.\n\n\n\"Professor Ducas?\" He asked in shock, and the dryad smiled, \"So you remember a few things from your past, at least.\"\n\n\nBraun stood up slowly, his scythe appearing in hand, \"I remember a man who swore to kill Death and destroy the Other Side. An abomination.\"\n\n\nAbigail rolled her eyes, flicking her wrist. Her black scales flew over her in a wave, and his scythe vanished.\n\n\nHe fell forwards in agony, clutching his chest as his magic seemed to tear from his hands.\n\n\nAbigail glared at the professor, \"You really have to provoke him?\"\n\n\nThe dryad frowned, \"You have developed some skill, Miss Ignis.\"\n\n\nShe shrugged, \"Something to do with a thousand cursed trying to kill me\u2026 Did you really swear to kill Death, herself?\"\n\n\nThe dryad winced, and Braun glared, \"Well?\"\n\n\n\"I did\u2026\" Duke hesitated, \"Until I met her. She took all that away. I'm a different creature now.\"\n\n\nAbigail cocked her head, \"What do you mean she took that away? What did she change?\"\n\n\nBraun smiled softly, \"Oh, I can answer that one. He wanted to kill our Queen because he'd lost someone dear to him, and thought that no one should be sent to the Other Side. Thought it just a prison.\"\n\n\nDuke glared at him, \"Don't you dare.\"\n\n\nBraun rolled his eyes, \"You really think she doesn't deserve to know? Know what drove you to Necromancy? The reason you never use it anymore?\"\n\n\nThe dryad clenched a fist, \"Necromancy is dangerous. It should not be used unless it has to.\"\n\n\n\"But you used it.\" Braun sneered, \"You used it when you shouldn't have, and our Queen came for you. A price must be paid.\"\n\n\nThe dryad shook his head, \"Please\u2026\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"My best friend just died. I'm not exactly in a caring mood. Duke\u2026 What in the Shades happened?\"\n\n\nThe professor leaned against a wall, and sighed, \"I discovered Necromancy after my mate died. I used it, not knowing that a price must always be paid. And so, the Lady came to me, explained my idiocy\u2026 And then she gave me till sundown. After that, she destroyed the soul of my mate\u2026 I can never bring her back again\u2026 The Black Queen\u2026 Destroyed\u2026 Her\u2026 Soul\u2026\"\n\n\nHe trailed off, tears running down his wooden face.\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"That's so\u2026 Cold\u2026\"\n\n\nBraun laughed, \"That's our Queen all over, Abigail. She is the end of all life, remember?\"\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"Then\u2026 Why does everyone keep telling me I'm her? I care\u2026 I love, I hurt, I feel betrayal\u2026 How can\u2026 I be Death?\"\n\n\nBraun looked at her, \"You are not our Queen, and I'd really rather you didn't call yourself by her name.\"\n\n\nAbigail launched to her feet, her anger exploding.\n\n\nHer scales turned black, her eyes glowed blue, her hair shone a brilliant white, and the light fled the room, leaving only her outline. Her voice echoed, \"Anima in tenebris. Ego non debilis. Sum Morte.\"\n\n\nHe cringed as the last word echoed in his mind.\n\n\nMorte\n\u2026 Death.",

            "text": "Abigail's steps were silent as she crept around the corners of the familiar hallways, desperately trying to ignore the statues that would turn and stare at her.  Duke didn't creep.  He strode, proud and sure in the knowledge that once observed, the past could not be changed.  They were just ghosts in the fog.  Cloudwalkers moving through memories.  Abigail struggled with that concept when everyone could see and interact with her.  They reached Duke's cold and dark office, with its door of living oak, and he banged loudly on it.  The door swung open, and Abigail winced as she saw Duke looking at Duke.  The one behind the desk laughed, \"Truly? You needed to return to me? What piece of knowledge have we forgotten?\"  The Duke that had come with her shrugged, \"What does it matter what I say, you will not recall it.\"  The Duke behind the table stood, his hands slamming down onto the table, but as they did they become a moving torrent of black liquid, moving towards them.  Duke slammed the door closed, and spun to Abigail, \"Run!\"  She found more magic in his statement than mere command, and found herself halfway down the hall before she could ask why.  The young nymph streaked down the hallways, wishing she had some level of control of her magic.  What use was she?  A stone hand jerked her to a stop, and Abigail spun.  The face of a statue stared into her, black liquid pouring from an empty visor.  Abigail cursed and tried to jerk away, but it was pathetic.  In instinct she reached out for Vitamancy, but felt nothing.  Her magic was gone.  Abigail clenched her fists, \"What do you want with me?\"  The possessed statue fell to its knees bowing till its head touched the ground.  Abigail winced, \"Say what?\"  It looked up at her and spoke.  The walls shook, stone fell from the ceilings, and Abigail felt herself fill with the uncontrolled magic she was beginning to grasp.  She felt her hair whip into a frenzy around her face, saw it streak to white in a moment.  \"We are honored to be in your presence.\"  Abigail sighed, and then heard something like metal strike the floor beside her, and she was winced as she saw the scythe in her hand.  \"Who are you?\"  The statue trembled in fear, \"We are the forgotten, the ones you cursed to wander the unchangeable memories of the past.\"  Abigail frowned, \"And you decided to attack passersby by yourself, did you?\"  The statue crumpled, forming a ball, as the voice reduced to a whisper, \"We were lost. We thought your rage would never end.\"  Abigail crouched, \"I've go news for you, dude. I am not Death.\"  The statue unfurled slowly, \"You are... I remember your face...\"  It paused, a trembling stone hand brushing her cheek, \"Yet... It was set hard with years of rage and destruction... It has been softened by happiness and... Love?\"  Abigail's heart jumped a beat as Kyle's face loomed in her mind. She smiled sweetly and took the stone hand, \"What crime did you commit?\"  The statue laughed, \"We dared to offer you our soul in exchange for power... We did not offer it to you direct... A member of your court.\"  Abigail frowned, \"And they would be?\"  \"War, Wrath, Sin, and Judgement.\" The statue stared at her, \"Have you forgotten all? Become a nymph to understand your enemy?\"  Abigail shrugged, \"I nearly died... Ever since, I have had this magic... Usually in the presence of... Well, I was kinda taught to call you... Abominations.\"  The statue laughed as it stood, \"The Lady of the Dark, the Queen of the Dead, reduced to a little nymph... Lost in a land of those who hate her...\"  Abigail spun the scythe, feeling the air tear apart, her vision sharpening, and she clenched a fist, \"If you want a fight, you have one.\"  The creature backed away, bowing low, \"Sorry, little nymph... There are many more of us... Than you and your little scythe.\"  She winced as the walls began to bleed, a thick black liquid creeping down, and Abigail knew she had picked the wrong fight.  She felt the scythe in her hand, the power it held.  She felt the air moving around her in a torrent, looking at her white hair being tossed about.  So be it.  If they called her Death, so she would be, and her hand would strike down like the hammer of the old gods.  Abigail embraced the rage, feeling her scales flickering in the air, seeing them change from a light blue to the blackest night.  She glared around, her scythe feeling like an extension of herself, and she felt her throat begin to vibrate.  She spoke, her voice echoing, the hidden strength in it threatening to tear the building apart, \"For crimes against your Queen, I sentence you to the Void.\"  Abigail shrugged, \"Come get your relief.\"    Duke was thrown against a wall, black tentacles encircling each of his roots, and he stared down at a bastardised form of himself.  The creature laughed, \"How did you do it, Adrian? Convince the Black Queen to forgive your debt?\"  Duke winced, \"So she truly is the Lady?\"  The shadow shrugged, \"We believe so... Not that it will matter.\"  It picked up a book from a nearby table, \"A fascinating read, professor. It is the reason we decided to stay here. Guard it's secrets.\"  Duke clenched his fists, struggling to find any purchase on magic.  The shadow shrugged, \"But then... We would know it's power, wouldn't we? We are the Merose, after all.\"  Duke winced, \"I don't want to control the Merose.\"  The shadow inside his past shrugged, \"No, you want to control the one who cursed us. Put us here... But we don't want that. She has offered us respite. Oblivion... For that... We welcome her.\"  Duke felt a chill run down his back, what had he done?  Bringing Abigail here had been a mistake.  There was a flash of fire, and Duke collapsed coughing to the ground.  He looked up, pausing as he saw Kyle.  His body was battered, his hair was singed. His clothes were little more than rags, but it was the young man's eyes that were the most telling.  They were red, puffy, and empty.  Duke winced, \"Kyle?\"  The young man clenched a fist and Duke was flung through the wall behind him.  He groaned, glancing up as Kyle walked over the rubble, \"I told you to protect her, Duke. I will not lose her as well.\"  Duke cringed, \"Fiona's dead?\"  Kyle stumbled, nearly collapsing, unable to speak, tears running down his cheeks. He nodded almost imperceptibly.  Duke stood up, \"How... You could bring her back.\"  Kyle shook his head, \"No... No I can't. She doesn't want to be brought back... She cursed her kingdom. All members of the Pact, dwarves and... Traitors... Can no longer set foot there.\"  Duke winced, \"And you are a traitor to the Other Side.\"  Kyle nodded, and Duke shrugged, \"Then break her spell.\"  The young man glared, \"You think I haven't tried? She made a aimimantic spell of eight verses, using dual reflection. I only know of one stronger, and it was used to make the gateway to the Other Side in the Shades!\"  Duke winced, \"I am so sorry, Kyle.\"  The young man turned, \"Let's go get Abigail.\"  \"She's not the one in danger, Kyle... The Merose thought she was the Lady, and that seals it for me. She is.\"  Kyle shook his head, and then vanished.  Duke sighed heavily.  He'd tried to teach Kyle, but now... He pitied the living.    Abigail slammed the butt of her scythe into the ground and the black liquid attempting to wash over her was shoved away, and she was left in a bubble of air, as the liquid lay frozen, washing above her in a frozen wave.  She felt something dark rising up in her, and she was tempted to obliterate it all, right now, in the moment.  Destroy them all.  It would be easy.  \"Neat trick, care to teach me it?\"  Abigail's hair dropped as the wind vanished, the scythe evaporated in her hand.  She turned and stared at Kyle through a frizzy mass of hair and instantly blushed, \"Hey.\"  He shook his head, and she saw the sadness.  She held out her hand, \"Show me.\"  Kyle shook his head, \"Not like this... Not right now.\"  Her voice echoed with power as she shouted, \"Show me!\"  Kyle stumbled, and winced, \"What in the Shades is happening to you, Abigail?\"  She collapsed onto her knees, clutching her head, gently rocking. \"It's all wrong, it's all wrong.\"  Kyle crouched in front of her, \"Then let's go home.\"  She didn't get a chance to argue.  They were simply back in the ruins, no more freaky black liquid attacking her, no more memories of war. No more soul of evil.  Abigail stared at the ground, \"You must hate me, Kyle.\"  She heard him make a sound of astonishment, and she shrugged, \"If it wasn't for me, you'd be with Fi, and she'd be safe.\"  Kyle sighed heavily, \"Fi... Fi went so that everyone else would have a chance. I couldn't stop her, I could barely help defend her.\"  Abigail felt tears rolling down her face, her scales fading back to blue, and she shrugged, \"If I wasn't in the way, you could have saved her... Back when this all started... It all would have been better if you never met me.\"  Kyle stared at her in shock, and Abigail looked down at the ground, guilt overwhelming her.  It was all her fault.  A calloused hand touched her cheek softly, and she looked up in surprise, tears running down her face, and she saw him smile at her, through the grief and stains of war.  He leaned in, his forehead touching hers, as she felt his emotions begin to flood over her.  Regret.  Isaac Isaac stood there, roaring, an enormous sword in his hand as he cut a swathe through his enemies.  The troll king stood, sword in hand, as the sun crept over the horizon.  He screamed in rage as his body turned to stone.  As the statue became complete, hammers struck hard, and he crumbled to dust.  Exhaustion.  Kyle flew above the world, rings of fire, stone and wind striking the ground.  A shield surrounded a nearby boulder, bound with Aimimancy, sucking him dry.  His grip on the magic keeping him in the air faltered, and he very nearly fell to his own death, barely clawing back on some hidden reserve of energy.  Hatred.  A dwarf laughed loudly, his hammer channeling lightning as he struck down those around him.  \"About time we made the elves extinct, isn't it boys?\"  Grief.  The boulder cracked open, a burst of blood shot into the air, and Kyle gasped as he felt the Aimimancy snapping into place, changing the world.  He had a fleeting glance of the disfigured pulp of bone and blood, that had once been Fiona.  Then he was gone.  Tears ran down Abigail's face as she breathed in Kyle's scent, and then a calloused hand took her chin gently between two fingers and raised her head.  Butterflies filled her stomach, as she stared into his eyes.  Confusion filled her head, her emotions were all over the place, and she didn't dare to trust her own muddled thoughts.  She didn't have to.  Her lips met his, as all around her danced the memories of Kyle's past.  Armies rose and died, as he held her in his arms.    Draco looked over as a wall was shattered to pieces, a dozen stone soldiers looking directly at him, and he frowned, \"The heir of the College has already been found... What do you want with me?\"  \"Fiona Applesilver is dead.\" A voice reverberated through his soul, and his eyes widened, fear itching up his spine.  Draco stared at them, \"And so you have chosen me?\"  The statue inclined his head slightly, and Draco grimaced, \"Bar the gates. Rebuild the walls. The College is to prepare for war.\"  He spun around, pausing as he saw a young man, his eyes bloodshot, standing behind him.  \"What war?\"  Bellum winced, \"You lost against the Pact. If you lost Fiona... They won.\"  Kyle smiled grimly, \"She banished us. The Elven kingdom is a stronghold against the dangers of this world, now.\"  Bellum winced, \"So the Pact will come here next. We need to prepare.\"  Kyle clenched a fist, and Draco screamed as he felt the blood.in his veins boil. He stared up at what had once been nothing more than a young student.  Kyle stood over him, \"There is so... Little... Stopping me sending you back to the Other Side... Did you know what?\"  Draco forced himself to his feet, relying on the fabled strength of his ancestors, \"I will stop you, if necessary, Master Kilroy.\"  Kyle rolled his eyes, and the pain vanished. \"We're not on equal ground, Headmaster... We were once... But it was a brief moment when a show of power could intimidate a young boy.\"  Draco smiled weakly, \"Seems you learned that lesson well.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"I don't want you to prepare for war, Headmaster. War means you get to fight back. Drive an enemy out into the open and cut them down.\"  Draco frowned, \"The College is being restored, Kyle. Careful about commanding its Headmaster.\"  Kyle smiled softly, \"I want you to defend something for me, Headmaster... If you fail... I will not fail to end this world.\"  Draco felt a chill run down his spine, \"Miss Ignis.\"  Kyle nodded, \"You'll find her... Difficult... But I need to end what I have started. If that means I go alone and buy everyone some more time... So be it.\"  Draco winced, \"You plan on taking the Shades by yourself?\"  Kyle shrugged, \"What choice do I have? Fiona is dead. Isaac Isaac is dead. Balta, Malata and New Rome are still infighting about who their next generals should be, and if they truly are bound to the Draco Charter.\"  Draco.winced, \"There are seven other magical establishments in this world. Seek help from them.\"  Kyle shook his head, \"They are the only reason you and I can still talk. After the Silvergate clan were butchered, they were the ones who rushed to protect the border... And others are busy with the Bloodbound Pact... I don't see any other solutions, Draco.\"  The Headmaster shook his head slowly, \"You are still just a student of Necromancy, Kyle. How do you expect to fight the creators of it?\"  He grinned, \"They don't use Necromancy, Headmaster. They use Messormancy, channeled from its source, the Lady Death.\"  Draco winced, \"Don't say her name.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"What of it? I've seen her face, Draco.\"  The half-dragon took a step backwards, \"I always wished that she and her court were just fairy tales.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Unfortunately, they're the ones trying to kill half this world, and keep it so. The living should never be allowed to outnumber the dead.\"  Draco shook his head, \"The Lady is the source of almost all magic... How can we survive this? How can you imagine that you could fight her?\"  Kyle laughed, \"I've already dealt my hand. Time will tell if I can get through this... Just... Keep Abigail safe. Without her, I won't need to destroy the world.\"  Draco nodded gravely, \"Fine. Where is she?\"  Kyle laughed and vanished.  Draco turned around and couldn't help staring.  The nymph was standing nearby, one hand on a broken wall, staring at the horizon.  Her scales were visible, her glamour gone. They were black, the edges tinged with red.  Her hair was black, with streaks of white, including her fringe.  But what truly made him fear, was the scythe sitting in her other hand.  She sighed heavily, \"Tell me, Headmaster, have you ever met a Reaper?\"  He winced, \"No, they have no business with the living.\"  She turned around, her eyes glowing, a brilliant blue. \"I am not a Reaper. I reap those who reap the dead.\"  Draco shivered, and then another figure entered the room slowly, an Elven man, and he smiled softly, \"And I will reap for you again.\"    Candice froze as the world around her grew dark. She muttered a spell, holding a fireball at the ready.  Laughter echoed around her.  She felt her anger, coaxing it, growing it to overcome the terror burning through her.  She ground her teeth, waiting impatiently.  But they liked to play with their food.  Make it scream and run, and just as you thought you might be able to escape, they'd swoop in and tear out your heart.  A swarm of flies appeared nearby, reassembling into a man. He smiled grimly, never glancing towards her. He clenched a fist, and then spoke, \"Annoying, aren't they, Candice? Taunting when they know they can't touch you.\"  She glared over at him, \"Oh really, Kyle? And why would that be? Because you're my night in shining armor?\"  Kyle laughed, \"Because of the Draco Charter. Every vampire in this world is bound by it, and the Lady has ratified it.\"  The swarm vanished, and they were left standing on snowy planes, alone.  Kyle turned towards her, \"What are you doing out here?\"  She.sneered, \"I'm a Silvergate, Kyle. I won't ignore them anymore, even if you are.\"  He sighed heavily, weariness rolling off him like a waterfall, \"Candice... You're the last of your bloodline. Fiona died defending the Elvish Kingdom from the Bloodbound Pact.\"  She frowned, processing it slowly, \"The Bloodbound want you gone.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"They be about to get their wish.\"  Candice blinked, \"You're headed to the Shades.\"  He nodded grimly, and she glanced around, \"You and what army?\"  Kyle laughed, \"I left my army at the College of History and Magic. I'm hoping that enough remnants of the other colleges still exist by the time I get to the Shades.\"  Candice sneered, \"You travelled to the Elven Kingdom quick enough. Why not do that again? Why are you here?\"  Kyle shook his head, \"You know the secret of the Shades, Candice... You know the Gateway there. I can't pet them know I'm coming... If I do, then they will be ready for me.\"  She shivered, despite herself, \"I've only seen the Gateway once, at my initiation... There's no way you could hope to get close. It's not guarded by hungry vampires, it has its own army. We call them -\"  \"- Reapers.\" Kyle finished, and nodded, \"I know... Did you hear what Abigail did before you left?\"  Candice stared, \"You really think she managed to cure a Reaper?\"  Kyle shook his head, \"No... She just gave him back his free will. He's guarding her now.\"  Candice scratched her head, \"You have a Reaper, and a Reaper-killer on your side. Why in the Shades are you leaving them behind?\"  \"You can't fight the Lady, Candice.\" Kyle sighed, shaking his head, \"No matter what you do... She comes for you in the end... I'm not going to fight them. I'm just going to stop them.\"  Candice felt her fury hit tipping point and the fireball launched towards him, growing to the size of a house before it hit him.  The fireball seemed to crash over him, and then it righted.  Kyle stood there, engulfed, \"Tell me, young Silvergate, is it only anger that can fuel Pyromancy?\"  She swallowed nervously, remembering her attacks on Fiona, \"Hatred works just as well.\"  The flames vanished and Kyle sighed, \"How about hating yourself?\"  She paused, surprised, \"I... Wouldn't know.\"  Kyle smiled, his eyes not quite touching it, \"No. You wouldn't. But you do know the Shades, and if I need to sneak up on anyone, it would need to be a Silvergate to guide me.\"  Candice paused, \"Instead of taking on the Shades by yourself... You want me to help you out?\"  Kyle shrugged, \"I've had worse ideas.\"  She rolled her eyes, \"Not by much... Come on, it'll take a week and a half.to get there.\"  Kyle rolled his eyes, \"I wasn't walking there.\"  Candice frowned, \"Then how? No magic, remember?\"  Kyle shook his head, \"No big or loud magic... Ever wanted to be able.to fly like a vamp?\"    Braun sat down in a chair carefully, letting out a long sigh of satisfaction.  Abigail's hands touched his shoulders, \"Getting comfortable are we?\"  He shot to his feet, surprised when she laughingly pushed him back into the chair, \"Relax, we aren't needed anywhere just yet.\"  Braun winced, \"Sorry... I haven't sat since... I died.\"  Abigail blinked, \"She that much of a bitch?\"  Braun shook his head, \"It's not that... The dead don't sleep... We have no time to relax.\"  \"But she sits on a big throne, doesn't she?\" Abigail asked, injustice ringing in her voice.  Braun shook his head, \"We rarely see our Queen... She maintains the Gateway to this realm, gives the Reapers their power,  oversees all of us... She maintains the Other Side, ensuring it doesn't just fall apart.\"  Abigail frowned, \"The Other Side could fall apart?\"  Braun smiled sheepishly, \"It's artificial. Shouldn't exist. The Lady created it, so that when people died, they shouldn't have to suffer as she did in life.\"  Abigail rolled her eyes, \"Dude. I wasn't brought up on your fairy tales. What suffering?\"  Braun shrugged, \"Something typical, I guess. Her lover fought in a war and died. Necromancy was impossible. She would never see him again, so she built a place where the dead would go, so that you could be reunited, never.to be separated again.\"  Abigail scratched her head, \"That sounds like a good thing. All sweet and cute... The Other Side is trying to destroy this world.\"  Braun shook his head, \"Not destroy. Absorb. No more death, no more pain. Utopia. At least, that's how War and Disaster try and sell it.\"  Abigail smiled, \"So... The Court of the Lady, they kind of rule in her stead?\"  Braun nodded, \"Yeah.\"  Abigail shrugged, \"Tell me more. Everything. Who are they? What is the Other Side like?\"  Braun smiled softly, \"You've never been?\"  \"I got stuck in Limbo for a week, and I went.to a place like a void... But it was bad.\" Abigail trailed off.  Braun swallowed, \"You went to the Clearing House. It's where.criminals are stripped of their immortality, and left to kill each other.\"  Abigail winced, \"That's just plain nasty.\"  Braun shrugged, \"It's either that or the Reapers eat your soul... And you become one of us.\"  Abigail scratched her chin, \"Are you the first free Reaper?\"  Braun shrugged, \"Maybe... May the first Reapers were free. Who knows? I'd guess a Reaper once got sent to the Clearing House, and the Lady didn't want to risk it ever again.\"  Abigail smiled, \"I need to see her.\"  Braun launched himself backwards out of the chair, scythe appearing in hand, \"Are you insane?\"  Abigail's blue scales faded to black, highlighting her eyes and hair, \"Do you think I'm insane?\"  Braun winced, \"You don't want to walk in there. The only way out, for the living, is by dying. By making a deal with a member of the court, to return.\"  Abigail laughed, her scales fading back to blue, and then to her white skin, \"Kyle made a deal with your Queen to protect me.\"  Braun scratched his head, \"Are you sure? I didn't get the memo.\"  Abigail winced, \"Oh no... Do you think it possible... That someone like War has... Usurped her?\"  Braun cringed, \"That's not... Possible.\"  Abigail raised an eyebrow, \"Really?\"  Braun sighed heavily, \"Discord has tried once or twice. But he was helping our Queen. Leading the invasion.\"  Abigail winced, \"So, it's possible. That Death isn't the bad guy here. She might just be a pawn, or figure head.\"  Braun burst out laughing, \"Our Queen? A pawn? She handbuilt another realm! Do you truly think anyone could control her?\"  Abigail's face clouded, \"You'd be surprised what people would do for the sake of love, family, and their own adulation.\"  Braun cocked his head, \"Speaking from experience?\"  She shook her head slowly, but for a moment her glamor collapsed, revealing the nymph beneath.  Braun ran a hand through his hair, and then sighed with relief as another figure entered the room.  The dryad cracked as he shrugged, \"So, Abigail, is this creature helpful to us?\"  Braun glared at him, \"I'm right here, Necromancer.\"  The dryad glanced at him, \"A fact I am painfully aware of, young elf.\"  Braun paused, \"You think you're older than me? Really?\"  The dryad laughed, \"You trained at the College of Pyromancy, nearly a thousand years ago, you impetuous twerp.\"  Braun started as memories flooded his mind, but most distinct was an old dryad, who had helped to found the College.  \"Professor Ducas?\" He asked in shock, and the dryad smiled, \"So you remember a few things from your past, at least.\"  Braun stood up slowly, his scythe appearing in hand, \"I remember a man who swore to kill Death and destroy the Other Side. An abomination.\"  Abigail rolled her eyes, flicking her wrist. Her black scales flew over her in a wave, and his scythe vanished.  He fell forwards in agony, clutching his chest as his magic seemed to tear from his hands.  Abigail glared at the professor, \"You really have to provoke him?\"  The dryad frowned, \"You have developed some skill, Miss Ignis.\"  She shrugged, \"Something to do with a thousand cursed trying to kill me\u2026 Did you really swear to kill Death, herself?\"  The dryad winced, and Braun glared, \"Well?\"  \"I did\u2026\" Duke hesitated, \"Until I met her. She took all that away. I'm a different creature now.\"  Abigail cocked her head, \"What do you mean she took that away? What did she change?\"  Braun smiled softly, \"Oh, I can answer that one. He wanted to kill our Queen because he'd lost someone dear to him, and thought that no one should be sent to the Other Side. Thought it just a prison.\"  Duke glared at him, \"Don't you dare.\"  Braun rolled his eyes, \"You really think she doesn't deserve to know? Know what drove you to Necromancy? The reason you never use it anymore?\"  The dryad clenched a fist, \"Necromancy is dangerous. It should not be used unless it has to.\"  \"But you used it.\" Braun sneered, \"You used it when you shouldn't have, and our Queen came for you. A price must be paid.\"  The dryad shook his head, \"Please\u2026\"  Abigail shrugged, \"My best friend just died. I'm not exactly in a caring mood. Duke\u2026 What in the Shades happened?\"  The professor leaned against a wall, and sighed, \"I discovered Necromancy after my mate died. I used it, not knowing that a price must always be paid. And so, the Lady came to me, explained my idiocy\u2026 And then she gave me till sundown. After that, she destroyed the soul of my mate\u2026 I can never bring her back again\u2026 The Black Queen\u2026 Destroyed\u2026 Her\u2026 Soul\u2026\"  He trailed off, tears running down his wooden face.  Abigail winced, \"That's so\u2026 Cold\u2026\"  Braun laughed, \"That's our Queen all over, Abigail. She is the end of all life, remember?\"  Abigail winced, \"Then\u2026 Why does everyone keep telling me I'm her? I care\u2026 I love, I hurt, I feel betrayal\u2026 How can\u2026 I be Death?\"  Braun looked at her, \"You are not our Queen, and I'd really rather you didn't call yourself by her name.\"  Abigail launched to her feet, her anger exploding.  Her scales turned black, her eyes glowed blue, her hair shone a brilliant white, and the light fled the room, leaving only her outline. Her voice echoed, \"Anima in tenebris. Ego non debilis. Sum Morte.\"  He cringed as the last word echoed in his mind.  Morte \u2026 Death.",

His hand traced the brickwork of the ancient school.\n\n\nHe knew it's cracks, where it had aged, and where masonry had prevailed.\n\n\nHe sighed heavily, pausing by a statue.\n\n\nIt saluted, and he nodded, \"Report?\"\n\n\nThe statue's voice echoed hollowly, \"The Sixth Army of the Shadowlands is one day out, inbound.\"\n\n\nDraco's face fell, \"Then the Seventh is close behind. The Shadowlands are empty... And I doubt the Charter will hold those who were protected by the Shades.\"\n\n\nThe statue put a hand on his sword, \"What are your orders, Headmaster?\"\n\n\nDraco winced, \"Prepare for the death of the school. We will fight till we have all died... But this battle is already lost.\"\n\n\nThe statue moved away with a solemn grace, it's orders already passing to the others.\n\n\nAll over the school he could hear dull thumps as its protectors once again prepared to defend it.\n\n\nDraco smiled grimly, the living statues were without a doubt the greatest invention of Headmaster Anderson, when he founded the school.\n\n\nHe foresaw the challenges to come... Draco winced, he wondered what Anderson would have done had he discovered the school together.\n\n\nThe man had been a prodigious talent, a master of Vitamancy, Aquamancy, Pyromancy and Ventusamancy.\n\n\nHis death had ended the age of the Founders, and the school had been slowly dying ever since.\n\n\nIt became harder and harder to find stable talent.\n\n\nAccidents like Professor Bracken had continually occurred, year after year. Though, normally it wasn't a student who fixed the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIlgun scrambled over the rocks, his old evlish fingers struggling to find purchase, sending stones scattering down on his pursuers.\n\n\nQueen Applesilver's magic had worked wonders.\n\n\nThe whole of the Bloodbound Pact had been evicted.\n\n\nHowever, it also meant that anyone who had ever betrayed another had also been evicted.\n\n\nAnd through his obsessions over his work, he had betrayed many people.\n\n\nHe felt his foot slip, and he crashed down into the darkness.\n\n\nIlgun smiled, despite the pain that told him he had broken his leg, or at least fractured it.\n\n\nHe was alone, if for but a moment.\n\n\nHe cast a quick spell, giving the ability to see in his small haven, and saw that he was in a cave, the ground covered nearly an inch in bat droppings, but the bats were still quietly asleep.\n\n\nIlgun waved a hand as he muttered, sending them into a coma.\n\n\nNow he was free to work.\n\n\nHe needed to find a way back into the Elven Kingdom, without breaking the spell.\n\n\nIlgun frowned and began to sketch in the sand.\n\n\nHe knew a little about the spell, and a few other things he could guess, but his knowledge of it wad far.from sure. His scrying had been interrupted by an axe landing next to him.\n\n\nAnd he couldn't scry without line of sight.\n\n\nSo what did he know?\n\n\nIt had been cast with Aimimancy, using Queen Applesilver's blood. She had been the last of the Applesilvers.\n\n\nWhich meant that only a Silvergate would now be able to tweak or break the spell.\n\n\nHowever, those half-Elven pigs were busy attempting to defend the world from the Shadowlands, thinking that they alone could save the world.\n\n\nIlgun snorted at their arrogance, and cringed as he heard cries from above, his attackers searching for him, he had little time.\n\n\nSo, he couldn't tweak the spell.\n\n\nSo what exactly did it do?\n\n\nIt had evicted all dwarves, trolls and possibly traitors, possibly elves of ill-intent.\n\n\nEvicted.\n\n\nIlgun smiled in the dark, Queen Applesilver had evicted them from the borders of the Elven Kingdom.\n\n\nAll he had to do was create a pocket inside the Kingdom that was its own space, not part of the Elven Kingdom, but protected by its spell and borders.\n\n\nAnd Kilroy had taught him how to create a portal safely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Slate knew he be not clever.\n\n\nHe be slow and very stupid.\n\n\nHe stood within a circle of the Brutes, the hard trolls, who had formed a wall, a brick against any who would interfere.\n\n\nLittle Slate stared at the circle, which lacked the body of the troll they be losing.\n\n\nIsaac Isaac.\n\n\nThis was his goodbye... What did he used to call it? Furn... Furnaral?\n\n\nLittle Slate sighed heavily and walked forward, ready to address the people who had chosen him as Troll King.\n\n\nWords disappeared.\n\n\nLittle Slate felt his shoulders buckle and tears form in his diamond eyes.\n\n\nHe felt a large hand land on his shoulder, and saw his big brother, Schism. He nodded, smiling, despite the tears in his own eyes.\n\n\nLittle Slate stood a little taller, and felt something deep inside him move, \"Isaac Isaac was one of us!\"\n\n\nHe heard the trolls snap to attention, as if they could feel the same thing.\n\n\n\"He was Troll King. He was strong. He was smart.\" Little Slate paused, surprised by the wolf-like anger in his voice. What did Isaac Isaac call it? Fearo... Never mind.\n\n\nThe new Troll King beat his chest, \"We miss Isaac Isaac.\"\n\n\nThen he raised his head to the sky, and let loose the trollish cry of... Pain.\n\n\nHe heard his brothers and sisters do the same.\n\n\nAll trolls screaming in pain.\n\n\nBea...you...to...full.\n\n\nBeautiful.\n\n\nA tear slipped down his stony face.\n\n\nSuddenly his emotions changed, as he heard a crash of steel on steel.\n\n\nHe spun, glaring, and saw the dwarves that had surrounded them, attacking.\n\n\nLittle Slate let out a roar of rage, felt it consume him.\n\n\nThis was rage.\n\n\nWar-anger.\n\n\n\"Beaters! Defilers! Cutters and biters!\" He roared, naming their crimes, the ways they broke Troll rule.\n\n\nThis was a Goodbye!\n\n\nLittle Slate snatched up his club from the ground and rushed towards them, followed by a thousand raging trolls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBracken screamed in agony.\n\n\nIt was all he had known, since Kyle Kilroy had torn his heart from his chest.\n\n\nKilroy was wrong.\n\n\nSome things were necessary, and fear was nothing to be feared.\n\n\nWhy couldn't he see? The world needed Aimimancers.\n\n\nNeeded them.\n\n\nTo guide them, to change them, to remake them.\n\n\nWithout them, the world was lost.\n\n\nThe world stopped.\n\n\nA thousand angry souls paused in mid-attack, and Bracken glared at the source.\n\n\nHe seemed alike to a man, but looks were deceptive.\n\n\nPower emanated from the man like nothing Bracken had ever felt.\n\n\nThe figure smiled, \"I have need of you, Bracken.\"\n\n\nHe frowned, \"More torturous than this place?\"\n\n\nThe figure shrugged, \"A matter of perspective. I need you in the living world.\"\n\n\nBracken stood up, blood pouring off him, reshaping constantly, \"What is it that you need me to do?\"\n\n\nThe figure smiled, \"Kill a dragon.\"\n\n\nBracken raised an eyebrow, \"Kill Bellum Draco?\"\n\n\nThe figure shrugged, \"After that, you're free to do as you wish. You'll have both your soul and body. Your debt to me will not exist... So long as Draco dies.\"\n\n\nBracken grinned, \"Then resurrect me already.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWes strode into the room, grinning from ear to ear. He saw the elf turn, and glance over him without recognition.\n\n\nHardly surprising, the.portraits were terrible.\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"Hi there, Braun. Got any brawn to back you up?\"\n\n\nThe scythe appeared in the elf's hand, and he glared, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\nHe laughed, \"Politeness first, fighting later. I am Wes Anderson, and in fact, I'm one of the Founders. I helped build this College, and seven others... It was an amazing age, Braun. We were pushing the limits of magic, and still, we were.finding new magics... That being said, I never did get a chance to learn Messormancy.\"\n\n\nBraun glared at him, \"Then you'd be dead. I don't see a debt in you, though.\"\n\n\nWes.rolled his eyes, \"There is a debt. But, he gave me a body and the cost is simple. Your life.\"\n\n\nBraun launched himself forwards, the thin blade slicing the air in front of him, but Wes simply laughed. A strand of Vitamancy wrapped around the scythe, causing it to attack it's master.\n\n\nBraun dismissed it, and Wes felt something dark grab his soul, attempting to eat it.\n\n\nHe ignored it and grabbed Braun by his shirt and yanked him into a headbutt, dropping the man on the floor.\n\n\nWes looked down at the dazed elf, \"Is that really all you can do? A bit of wild Messormancy and you're done?\"\n\n\nHe shook his head, as a sword of fire and wind appeared in his hand, \"Say hello to the King for me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandice pushed her hair out of her eyes as the sand began to whip up around them, she spoke muffled through the cloth over her mouth, \"Welcome to the outskirts, Kilroy.\"\n\n\nKyle seemed entirely unfazed by the sand whipping at him, and shrugged, \"Sort of.\"\n\n\nCandice frowned, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\nKyle out a hand in the air, a clump of sand surrounded him, and he smiled grimly, \"This is a magical occurrence. Not just the weirdness of the Shades. We have a welcoming party incoming.\"\n\n\nCandice shrugged immediately tensed, two flames burning in her hands as she struggled to see through the dust that was pricking at her face.\n\n\nNormally the sensation would feel like a relief. Feel like home... But not here.\n\n\nNot now.\n\n\nKyle suddenly tensed, \"Messormancy. Hide.\"\n\n\nCandice dropped to the ground, allowing the sand to hide her from sight, her.flames winking out.\n\n\nShe heard footsteps at length, grinding and crunching as they stepped across the ground.\n\n\nThe sand suddenly stopped and collapsed to the ground.\n\n\nShe heard a voice, but she couldn't tell how close it was. It vibrated the ground, and latched onto the fear inside her.\n\n\n\"Come out, little play things. I have a lesson to teach.\"\n\n\nThere was a gust of air and Kyle exploded out of the sand beside her, in fact, she was nearly certain that he had managed to turn himself to sand.\n\n\nBut she knew the risks, and shot up as quickly as she could, which felt sort of slow motion.\n\n\nA fireball shot from her hands, vanishing from sight as the flames grew too hot to see.\n\n\nThere was a man standing there, smug and sure.\n\n\nIn other circumstances Candice would probably wonder what he'd be like in bed. As it was, the gorgeous faerie sort of ignored the impact of her fireball as the ground beneath him turned into a hundred spikes ramming through his body.\n\n\nKyle instantly began muttering, preparing a spell, but the faerie opened his hand, a scythe appearing in it.\n\n\nHe brushed the spikes away like he was shooing a fly and stepped forward, the blade of the scythe swinging almost casually at Kyle.\n\n\nThe necromancer grabbed the blade and wrenched, tossing the scythe aside, his hand became a sword and he rammed it through the Reaper's throat.\n\n\nThe Reaper rolled his eyes as the scythe vanished midair, and reappeared in his hand. He headbutted Kyle backwards and swung his blade upwards.\n\n\nKyle.collapsed onto the ground as the sand turned red.\n\n\nCandice suddenly realized that she was now the focus of attention.\n\n\nThe Reaper grinned, \"The Shadowlands are closed, even to the last of the Silvergate clan.\"\n\n\nThen she was on the ground, unable to breath.\n\n\nHer thoughts were scattered, fleeing her, but the last thing she could think was simple enough.\n\n\nShe was dying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail stepped back into the room, a plate of food in her hand, \"Braun, I actually managed to find something edible!\"\n\n\nThe salad tumbled, the plate shattering on the ground.\n\n\nAbigail was beside Braun before it had begun moving, her hand touching his cheek, staring at the hole were his heart used to be.\n\n\nHe was gone.\n\n\nShe heard a juicy crunch and looked up, staring at a man she had killed, eating a heart.\n\n\nWes grinned, \"Hey girl.\"\n\n\nAbigail stood up, the lights in the room began to flicker.\n\n\nWes dropped the heart, wiping his hands on his pants, \"Oh, I'm sorry, did you care.for him?\"\n\n\nAbigail clenched her fists, feeling the familiar feeling of wood.as the scythe appeared in her hand.\n\n\nWes shrugged, \"Aren't you a little.curious? You killed me. I was already a ghost, so you kinda exploded my soul... But here I am, in.the flesh.\"\n\n\nAbigail sneered, \"I can see the magic binding you. You were sent to the Clearing House when I killed you... Now the only question is, which member.of the Court.sent you here.\"\n\n\nWes shrugged, \"Oh well. I guess there's nothing else to say.\"\n\n\nHe yelled a spell, the entire contents.of the room was tossed backwards by the wind, but Abigail's hair barely moved. She smiled softly, \"That all you have? I thought you were a Founder?\"\n\n\nThen she swung her scythe, and the wind reversed, pinning Wes to the brickwork, cracking the wall.and shattering the windows.\n\n\nShe strode.forward, feeling the magic inside her like an old friend. She knew it now, understood it's nuances.\n\n\nShe placed the tip of her blade on the inside of Wes' left leg, and.grinned, \"Don't screw with things you don't understand, boy.\"\n\n\nWes winced and tried to smile, \"It was worth a shot.\"\n\n\nAbigail spun around, her blade a blur.\n\n\nShe heard him slump to the ground as blood dripped from the scythe.\n\n\nBut she wasn't done yet.\n\n\nShe felt the soul twitch, and spun back, holding out her hand.\n\n\nWes gasped, suddenly dangling in the air.\n\n\nAbigail cocked her head, \"You're not going back to the Clearing House, not this time.\"\n\n\nWes' terrified face sank to a deathly yellow, \"Please... Mercy... Just bind me here... I'll be a ghost. I won't be able to do anything!\"\n\n\nAbigail shook her head, \"You ate the heart of one of the few people I have ever been able to call a friend.\"\n\n\nShe clenched her fist, and the soul turned to confetti.\n\n\nA brick tumbled from the roof above her, and she winced.\n\n\nHe had been a Founder... And now his magic no longer worked.\n\n\nA doorway collapsed with a sound akin to thunder, and Abigail winced, sitting down beside Braun's body, feeling the soul still bound to his body.\n\n\nShe smiled, breaking the tender threads, letting him go free.\n\n\nBut as Braun's soul vanished, moving on, something went with him. A small spell.\n\n\nAbigail felt her face harden and she stood up, and the room she was in stopped collapsing. She needed to concentrate. This was something dangerous, insane, and.totally her.\n\n\nShe flicked her wrist, generating a wand.of Messormancy and Vitamancy.\n\n\nIt had been a long time since she held.a wand, almost felt like a lifetime. She smiled, for Kyle, it had been.\n\n\nShe flicked her wrist.fluidly, and a circle embedded itself in the floor.\n\n\nAnother circle appeared somewhere else.\n\n\nNow all she had to do, was join them.\n\n\nFor Kyle, he had had to steal energy from the end of the universe. For her, it was simpler.\n\n\nShe stole hers from the other end of the tunnel.\n\n\nThe circle flickered for a moment, and then there was an ungodly roar as the Portal opened, and more magic than she had ever felt began to tear through her, just to sustain it remaining open.\n\n\nThere was a pop, and a Dryad appeared beside her, \"Stop! This is madness!\"\n\n\nAbigail shrugged, \"That's what I'm best at, remember?\"\n\n\nDuke shot a bolt of Vitamancy at her, and it lodged somewhere inside.\n\n\nEverything changed.\n\n\nThe anger inside her, the rage that dwelt just below the surface, it stirred.\n\n\nShe'd always felt like she was watching, when the Messormancy overpowered her, like a hungry tiger on the attack.\n\n\nNot this time.\n\n\nIt was hers, her rage. Her anger. Her power.\n\n\nShe reached out and seized his soul, sitting there in.the fabric of magic, and twisted.\n\n\nDuke screamed, dropping to the ground, holding his head. Abigail sneered, \"You are Broken.\"\n\n\nHe stared up at her, \"Why? Why would you do that?\"\n\n\nAbigail sneered, \"And now I'll take your soul.\"\n\n\nShe moved faster than he could even breathe, and his head tumbled to the ground.\n\n\nShe turned back to the Portal, ready to take her to the Other Side.\n\n\n\"I am Death, and your debt is done.\"",

Accidents like Professor Bracken had continually occurred, year after year. Though, normally it wasn't a student who fixed the problem.    Ilgun scrambled over the rocks, his old evlish fingers struggling to find purchase, sending stones scattering down on his pursuers.  Queen Applesilver's magic had worked wonders.  The whole of the Bloodbound Pact had been evicted.  However, it also meant that anyone who had ever betrayed another had also been evicted.  And through his obsessions over his work, he had betrayed many people.  He felt his foot slip, and he crashed down into the darkness.  Ilgun smiled, despite the pain that told him he had broken his leg, or at least fractured it.  He was alone, if for but a moment.  He cast a quick spell, giving the ability to see in his small haven, and saw that he was in a cave, the ground covered nearly an inch in bat droppings, but the bats were still quietly asleep.  Ilgun waved a hand as he muttered, sending them into a coma.  Now he was free to work.  He needed to find a way back into the Elven Kingdom, without breaking the spell.  Ilgun frowned and began to sketch in the sand.  He knew a little about the spell, and a few other things he could guess, but his knowledge of it wad far.from sure. His scrying had been interrupted by an axe landing next to him.  And he couldn't scry without line of sight.  So what did he know?  It had been cast with Aimimancy, using Queen Applesilver's blood.

Ilgun snorted at their arrogance, and cringed as he heard cries from above, his attackers searching for him, he had little time.  So, he couldn't tweak the spell.  So what exactly did it do?  It had evicted all dwarves, trolls and possibly traitors, possibly elves of ill-intent.  Evicted.  Ilgun smiled in the dark, Queen Applesilver had evicted them from the borders of the Elven Kingdom.  All he had to do was create a pocket inside the Kingdom that was its own space, not part of the Elven Kingdom, but protected by its spell and borders.  And Kilroy had taught him how to create a portal safely.    Little Slate knew he be not clever.  He be slow and very stupid.  He stood within a circle of the Brutes, the hard trolls, who had formed a wall, a brick against any who would interfere.  Little Slate stared at the circle, which lacked the body of the troll they be losing.  Isaac Isaac.  This was his goodbye... What did he used to call it? Furn... Furnaral?  Little Slate sighed heavily and walked forward, ready to address the people who had chosen him as Troll King.  Words disappeared.  Little Slate felt his shoulders buckle and tears form in his diamond eyes.  He felt a large hand land on his shoulder, and saw his big brother, Schism. He nodded, smiling, despite the tears in his own eyes.  Little Slate stood a little taller, and felt something deep inside him move, \"Isaac Isaac was one of us!\"  He heard the trolls snap to attention, as if they could feel the same thing.  \"He was Troll King. He was strong. He was smart.\" Little Slate paused, surprised by the wolf-like anger in his voice. What did Isaac Isaac call it? Fearo... Never mind.  The new Troll King beat his chest, \"We miss Isaac Isaac.\"  Then he raised his head to the sky, and let loose the trollish cry of... Pain.  He heard his brothers and sisters do the same.  All trolls screaming in pain.  Bea...you...to...full.  Beautiful.  A tear slipped down his stony face.  Suddenly his emotions changed, as he heard a crash of steel on steel.  He spun, glaring, and saw the dwarves that had surrounded them, attacking.  Little Slate let out a roar of rage, felt it consume him.  This was rage.  War-anger.  \"Beaters! Defilers! Cutters and biters!\" He roared, naming their crimes, the ways they broke Troll rule.  This was a Goodbye!  Little Slate snatched up his club from the ground and rushed towards them, followed by a thousand raging trolls.    Bracken screamed in agony.  It was all he had known, since Kyle Kilroy had torn his heart from his chest.  Kilroy was wrong.  Some things were necessary, and fear was nothing to be feared.  Why couldn't he see? The world needed Aimimancers.  Needed them.  To guide them, to change them, to remake them.  Without them, the world was lost.  The world stopped.  A thousand angry souls paused in mid-attack, and Bracken glared at the source.  He seemed alike to a man, but looks were deceptive.  Power emanated from the man like nothing Bracken had ever felt.  The figure smiled, \"I have need of you, Bracken.\"  He frowned, \"More torturous than this place?\"  The figure shrugged, \"A matter of perspective. I need you in the living world.\"  Bracken stood up, blood pouring off him, reshaping constantly, \"What is it that you need me to do?\"  The figure smiled, \"Kill a dragon.\"  Bracken raised an eyebrow, \"Kill Bellum Draco?\"  The figure shrugged, \"After that, you're free to do as you wish. You'll have both your soul and body. Your debt to me will not exist... So long as Draco dies.\"  Bracken grinned, \"Then resurrect me already.\"    Wes strode into the room, grinning from ear to ear. He saw the elf turn, and glance over him without recognition.  Hardly surprising, the.portraits were terrible.  He shrugged, \"Hi there, Braun. Got any brawn to back you up?\"  The scythe appeared in the elf's hand, and he glared, \"Who are you?\"  He laughed, \"Politeness first, fighting later. I am Wes Anderson, and in fact, I'm one of the Founders. I helped build this College, and seven others... It was an amazing age, Braun. We were pushing the limits of magic, and still, we were.finding new magics... That being said, I never did get a chance to learn Messormancy.\"  Braun glared at him, \"Then you'd be dead. I don't see a debt in you, though.\"  Wes.rolled his eyes, \"There is a debt. But, he gave me a body and the cost is simple. Your life.\"  Braun launched himself forwards, the thin blade slicing the air in front of him, but Wes simply laughed. A strand of Vitamancy wrapped around the scythe, causing it to attack it's master.  Braun dismissed it, and Wes felt something dark grab his soul, attempting to eat it.  He ignored it and grabbed Braun by his shirt and yanked him into a headbutt, dropping the man on the floor.  Wes looked down at the dazed elf, \"Is that really all you can do? A bit of wild Messormancy and you're done?\"  He shook his head, as a sword of fire and wind appeared in his hand, \"Say hello to the King for me.\"    Candice pushed her hair out of her eyes as the sand began to whip up around them, she spoke muffled through the cloth over her mouth, \"Welcome to the outskirts, Kilroy.\"  Kyle seemed entirely unfazed by the sand whipping at him, and shrugged, \"Sort of.\"  Candice frowned, \"What do you mean?\"  Kyle out a hand in the air, a clump of sand surrounded him, and he smiled grimly, \"This is a magical occurrence. Not just the weirdness of the Shades. We have a welcoming party incoming.\"  Candice shrugged immediately tensed, two flames burning in her hands as she struggled to see through the dust that was pricking at her face.  Normally the sensation would feel like a relief. Feel like home... But not here.  Not now.  Kyle suddenly tensed, \"Messormancy. Hide.\"  Candice dropped to the ground, allowing the sand to hide her from sight, her.flames winking out.  She heard footsteps at length, grinding and crunching as they stepped across the ground.  The sand suddenly stopped and collapsed to the ground.  She heard a voice, but she couldn't tell how close it was. It vibrated the ground, and latched onto the fear inside her.  \"Come out, little play things. I have a lesson to teach.\"  There was a gust of air and Kyle exploded out of the sand beside her, in fact, she was nearly certain that he had managed to turn himself to sand.  But she knew the risks, and shot up as quickly as she could, which felt sort of slow motion.  A fireball shot from her hands, vanishing from sight as the flames grew too hot to see.  There was a man standing there, smug and sure.  In other circumstances Candice would probably wonder what he'd be like in bed. As it was, the gorgeous faerie sort of ignored the impact of her fireball as the ground beneath him turned into a hundred spikes ramming through his body.  Kyle instantly began muttering, preparing a spell, but the faerie opened his hand, a scythe appearing in it.  He brushed the spikes away like he was shooing a fly and stepped forward, the blade of the scythe swinging almost casually at Kyle.  The necromancer grabbed the blade and wrenched, tossing the scythe aside, his hand became a sword and he rammed it through the Reaper's throat.  The Reaper rolled his eyes as the scythe vanished midair, and reappeared in his hand. He headbutted Kyle backwards and swung his blade upwards.  Kyle.collapsed onto the ground as the sand turned red.  Candice suddenly realized that she was now the focus of attention.  The Reaper grinned, \"The Shadowlands are closed, even to the last of the Silvergate clan.\"  Then she was on the ground, unable to breath.  Her thoughts were scattered, fleeing her, but the last thing she could think was simple enough.  She was dying.    Abigail stepped back into the room, a plate of food in her hand, \"Braun, I actually managed to find something edible!\"  The salad tumbled, the plate shattering on the ground.  Abigail was beside Braun before it had begun moving, her hand touching his cheek, staring at the hole were his heart used to be.  He was gone.  She heard a juicy crunch and looked up, staring at a man she had killed, eating a heart.  Wes grinned, \"Hey girl.\"  Abigail stood up, the lights in the room began to flicker.  Wes dropped the heart, wiping his hands on his pants, \"Oh, I'm sorry, did you care.for him?\"  Abigail clenched her fists, feeling the familiar feeling of wood.as the scythe appeared in her hand.  Wes shrugged, \"Aren't you a little.curious? You killed me. I was already a ghost, so you kinda exploded my soul... But here I am, in.the flesh.\"  Abigail sneered, \"I can see the magic binding you. You were sent to the Clearing House when I killed you... Now the only question is, which member.of the Court.sent you here.\"  Wes shrugged, \"Oh well. I guess there's nothing else to say.\"  He yelled a spell, the entire contents.of the room was tossed backwards by the wind, but Abigail's hair barely moved. She smiled softly, \"That all you have? I thought you were a Founder?\"  Then she swung her scythe, and the wind reversed, pinning Wes to the brickwork, cracking the wall.and shattering the windows.  She strode.forward, feeling the magic inside her like an old friend. She knew it now, understood it's nuances.  She placed the tip of her blade on the inside of Wes' left leg, and.grinned, \"Don't screw with things you don't understand, boy.\"  Wes winced and tried to smile, \"It was worth a shot.\"  Abigail spun around, her blade a blur.  She heard him slump to the ground as blood dripped from the scythe.  But she wasn't done yet.  She felt the soul twitch, and spun back, holding out her hand.  Wes gasped, suddenly dangling in the air.  Abigail cocked her head, \"You're not going back to the Clearing House, not this time.\"  Wes' terrified face sank to a deathly yellow, \"Please... Mercy... Just bind me here... I'll be a ghost. I won't be able to do anything!\"  Abigail shook her head, \"You ate the heart of one of the few people I have ever been able to call a friend.\"  She clenched her fist, and the soul turned to confetti.  A brick tumbled from the roof above her, and she winced.  He had been a Founder... And now his magic no longer worked.  A doorway collapsed with a sound akin to thunder, and Abigail winced, sitting down beside Braun's body, feeling the soul still bound to his body.  She smiled, breaking the tender threads, letting him go free.  But as Braun's soul vanished, moving on, something went with him. A small spell.  Abigail felt her face harden and she stood up, and the room she was in stopped collapsing. She needed to concentrate. This was something dangerous, insane, and.totally her.  She flicked her wrist, generating a wand.of Messormancy and Vitamancy.  It had been a long time since she held.a wand, almost felt like a lifetime. She smiled, for Kyle, it had been.  She flicked her wrist.fluidly, and a circle embedded itself in the floor.  Another circle appeared somewhere else.  Now all she had to do, was join them.  For Kyle, he had had to steal energy from the end of the universe. For her, it was simpler.  She stole hers from the other end of the tunnel.  The circle flickered for a moment, and then there was an ungodly roar as the Portal opened, and more magic than she had ever felt began to tear through her, just to sustain it remaining open.  There was a pop, and a Dryad appeared beside her, \"Stop! This is madness!\"  Abigail shrugged, \"That's what I'm best at, remember?\"  Duke shot a bolt of Vitamancy at her, and it lodged somewhere inside.  Everything changed.  The anger inside her, the rage that dwelt just below the surface, it stirred.  She'd always felt like she was watching, when the Messormancy overpowered her, like a hungry tiger on the attack.  Not this time.  It was hers, her rage. Her anger. Her power.  She reached out and seized his soul, sitting there in.the fabric of magic, and twisted.  Duke screamed, dropping to the ground, holding his head. Abigail sneered, \"You are Broken.\"  He stared up at her, \"Why? Why would you do that?\"  Abigail sneered, \"And now I'll take your soul.\"  She moved faster than he could even breathe, and his head tumbled to the ground.  She turned back to the Portal, ready to take her to the Other Side.  \"I am Death, and your debt is done.\"",

            "text": "Chapter Nineteen\n\n\n\n\nKyle sat up, coughing violently.\n\n\nThe shadow standing over him shot back, and Kyle craned his neck, one handing shielding the sun.\n\n\nIt was an old man, his white beard stretching halfway down his chest, his eyes a strange blue, flecked with gold. In his hand he held a wand, a dark redwood, with a small leaf bound around it.\n\n\nKyle laughed weakly, \"Pyromancers. Everywhere I go.\"\n\n\nThe man winced, \"How are you alive?\"\n\n\nKyle forced himself to his feet, spotting the crumpled mass that was Candice with a wince. He crouched by her, \"You tried to heal her... A... Binding spell?\"\n\n\nThe man ground his teeth, \"You were attacked by a foul creature. You need to leave.\"\n\n\nKyle nodded, \"A Reaper... I wasn't close enough to use the magic I should have... Ah, here we go... There's the spark of life.\"\n\n\nCandice coughed, dust erupting from around her face.\n\n\nThe man clenched a fist, flames bursting out across his skin, \"You need to leave.\"\n\n\nKyle turned, \"Black. You're the only Pyromancer I know of who doesn't have to chant, when not using their channel.\"\n\n\nHeadmaster Damien Black of the Professional Pyromantic College sneered, \"And who are you, boy?\"\n\n\n\"Kyle Kilroy, student of Aimimancy and Necromancy.\"\n\n\nThe Headmaster winced, \"About time... But you're too late. I'm the last one.\"\n\n\nKyle cocked his head, \"What happened? One Reaper couldn't do this, and I wiped out the majority of the Vampiric Armies.\"\n\n\nBlack sighed and shook his head, \"There is an army of twenty thousand Reapers, not ten minutes from here. You need to run.\"\n\n\nKyle smiled grimly, and the Headmaster's face took on a look of fear as the sun began to dim, as if an eclipse were overtaking it.\n\n\n\"Headmaster, run. This is what I came for. The Portal to the Other Side, guarded by the army of Reapers.\"\n\n\n\"One Reaper nearly killed you!\" Black shouted angrily, and Kyle laughed, \"Until right now... I have used Necromancy a total of four times. Aimimancy alone has been my strength... I am ready for this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Slate didn't have an understanding of fate.\n\n\nHe didn't know destiny, or the concept of the inevitable.\n\n\nBut he knew something felt different.\n\n\nIn the midst of heated battle, dwarvish hammers against trollish clubs, he had found a sense of destiny.\n\n\nIn front of him, with gleaming axe, was the creature he loathed more than any other.\n\n\nThe dwarf launched himself towards him, and Little Slate clumsily blocked the blow, and punched down, dazing the dwarf.\n\n\n\"Defiler-king!\" He spat, swinging his club around, but too slowly. The dwarf rolled under it, and leaped up, his axe lodging in Little Slate's shoulder.\n\n\nHe ignored the pain and kicked as hard as he could, sending the dwarf and his considerable.girth tumbling.\n\n\nThe man was instantly on his feet again, \"I am here to cleanse this.world of those akin to you, stupid, unhelpful and a stain on this world's history.\"\n\n\nLittle Slate didn't understand the words, but he knew an insult when he heard it.\n\n\nHe tore the axe free and threw it, hard.\n\n\nThe dwarf deftly danced out of the way, wobbling as he went, before launching a tiny steel bolt from his hand.\n\n\nLittle Slate yelled loudly as it went through one of his eyes, but he ignored it, grabbing his club with both hands and began to beat the ground where he thought the dwarf might be.\n\n\nThe man easily avoided his clumsy blows, before grabbing his axe and with a blow faster than Little Slate could realize, cut one of his hands off.\n\n\nThe club tumbled to the ground, and as it did, a dwarfish axe shattered his left leg. Not that he knew his left from his right.\n\n\nLittle Slate fell to the ground, the dwarvish leader of the Bloodbound Pact standing in front of him, \"Are you ready to die, troll?\"\n\n\nLittle Slate grinned and pushed himself, his whole bulk suddenly landing on top of the troll, his one hand came around, and grabbed the struggling dwarf's head.\n\n\nHe stopped struggling with a pop.\n\n\nLittle Slate rolled over, feeling the weak trying to overtake all in him.\n\n\nBattle lost.\n\n\nHe dying.\n\n\nBut dwarf-king dead.\n\n\nHe sighed sadly, and closed his eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hard black stone that made up the ground cracked as Abigail's foot touched down.\n\n\nShe was home.\n\n\nThere was a pause as the vortex behind her fell apart, and the occupants of the Void looked at her, and she smiled softly.\n\n\nThey ran towards her.\n\n\nThis was the Clearing House, and she would clear it.\n\n\nThe scythe appeared in her hand, and she made an upwards cutting message. A swath of souls went down, shredded.\n\n\nBut there were more than enough to make things interesting for her.\n\n\nShe was Death, and they had died.\n\n\nTheir souls were hers.\n\n\nShe weaved deftly as a sword made of bone tried to tear, and it was more tear than cut, her throat.\n\n\nAbigail toyed with the man, a dark elf, probably from before her memories as a ny.ph stretched back. She briefly wondered if she'd ever get her memories back.\n\n\nThere was a usurper to be punished.\n\n\nSomeone had done this to her.\n\n\nThe butt of her scythe hit the ground, the souls freezing in place.\n\n\nShe made a sweeping gesture, and the souls were torn apart, fading.\n\n\nShe was alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBracken grinned as he ducked passed a falling stone and danced over some cracks in the floor.\n\n\nHe saw his target, as regal and sure as always, standing beside a circular crack, uttering some spell.\n\n\nHe laughed, \"I can send you after her, Bellum. Wouldn't take much.\"\n\n\nThe half-dragon spun around with surprising grace, considering the building was falling apart.\n\n\nBracken shrugged, \"Why did you leave me dead, Draco?\"\n\n\nThe man sneered, \"You were better off that way.\"\n\n\nBracken shook his head, \"I tried to keep Kyle occupied. I tried to tutor him, protect him. You let him die, and created the monster that has led to this moment.\"\n\n\nDraco shrugged, \"A better monster than you.\"\n\n\nBracken drew and flicked his wand in a smooth motion, and Draco froze, rigid. The professor glared, \"This is the spell I died for, Headmaster. The impossible, illegal one... Wouldn't it be fitting if I just left you here, let the College kill you?\"\n\n\nBracken sighed heavily, \"But then again... You're a half dragon. You wouldn't be killed. You'd survive, and that fiery passion would ruin every chance I've been given at a second chance.\"\n\n\nBefore he had a chance to gloat some more he felt his spell snap, and a dragon-scaled hand rammed up against his throat with a crushing grip. Bracken flicked his wand, sending them both flying.\n\n\nHe hit the ground tumbling, and then the ground beneath him shifted.\n\n\nThe whole school building had turned into little more than a child's wood block house.\n\n\nHe pushed himself upward, solidifying the air and stood there.\n\n\nNot for long.\n\n\nDraco was opposite him, both wings unfurled, his veins glowing a deep red through his scales, and his eyes had turned black.\n\n\nHe'd finally let the dragon out.\n\n\nBracken roared, flicking his wrist, a spell half formed in the air. But it wasn't enough, and it wasn't soon enough. The half-dragon slammed into him, claws biting into his shoulders as Draco roared, flames engulfing him.\n\n\nThe Aimimancer struggled for a moment, feeling his own pulse, his own blood, and tried to unleash it. Force some distance between the dragon and himself.\n\n\nHis spells were shattered by the energy screaming out from the figure holding him.\n\n\nIf it weren't for the sheer rage of the dragon he'd be dead already, and if he failed there would be no coming back.\n\n\nA spell he'd only ever read about, and never dared to try and conjure entered his mind.\n\n\nIt was destructive, and focused on a genetic trait, causing many thousands to die... But there was only one like Draco.\n\n\nHe cast it.\n\n\nIt took more power than he expected, nearly burning him out, the magic sapping all he had.\n\n\nHe fell onto the rickety floor, as two feet solidly hit in front of him.\n\n\nBracken stared up at the dragon, bleeding from head to toe.\n\n\nHis tail was poised in the air, and struck hard, piercing straight through Bracken's abdomen and out his back.\n\n\nHe laughed, his wand twirling as his own injuries began to vanish, but he held tight to the tail as the dragon seemed dazed for a moment.\n\n\n\"Instinct can only get you so far, Bellum.\"\n\n\nHe stood tall, smiling, trying to forget it was chance alone that he hadn't died.\n\n\nHow the hell could a dragon take so much damage and keep standing? Even now, with what should have been death's doorway hanging over him, Draco seemed to be not much more than dizzy and surprised.\n\n\nBracken flicked his wrist, breaking the Headmaster's wand. That would have been annoying.\n\n\nHe held out his hand, blood pooling into a ball above it, and he looked up at the man who had always stood in his way. The man who had always threatened to destroy him, if he stepped a foot out of line. The man who had had the power to save him from the Clearing House, but had left him to die.\n\n\nIt was over now.\n\n\nHe knew how to kill a dragon.\n\n\nJust use anything with overkill.\n\n\nHe had felt a yell rip un-bidden from his throat as he slammed the ball into Draco's chest, and it erupted outwards, a volcanic reaction.\n\n\nHe saw the school drifting below him, the pieces that had been the Headmaster scattered around the room, and he smiled.\n\n\nThen he felt a twitch.\n\n\nHe looked down at the tail still embedded in his stomach, just in time for it to wrap around his throat and go taut.\n\n\nAs he began to fall, he knew it was too late.\n\n\nDraco was a tough bastard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe storm spun furiously above his head, as spells rained down.\n\n\nIlgun was focused, more than he had ever been in his long and varied career, and blocking out attackers whilst attempting something new was something of a specialty.\n\n\nThat being said, so far, he'd underestimated the power he'd needed almost a dozen times.\n\n\nKilroy had asserted that he'd need the potential energy from a universal collapse, but to be frank, it sounded ludicrous. Something short of that utter destruction should be possible.\n\n\nIt had to be.\n\n\nA fireball broke through the barrier and hit the ground beside him with a puff of dirt and smoke.\n\n\nThat was a bad sign.\n\n\nHe just had to transport himself without touching Elvish soil. He'd already managed to convince his late Queen's spell that his house didn't really belong to the Kingdom. That had been easy. A little Aimimancy.\n\n\nThe minimum size of the portal had to be related to the energy required to generate it, not just the distance covered... Otherwise he'd have made the portal already... What was the math Kilroy had sketched out?\n\n\nA boulder about ten times his body wait hit the ground and kept going.\n\n\nNegative mass.\n\n\nHe'd assumed that magic could simply equate for that, cancel out the negative mass of the tunnel with a positive mass... But maybe not.\n\n\nIf it didn't cancel out, then you had to adjust the frequency of the fields employed until everything was positive, and physics would take over and create the negative... And rip open a tunnel that you could pass through.\n\n\nIlgun suddenly flung himself aside as his whole cloud turned into a churning fireball and hit the ground.\n\n\nHe swore loudly, no time to test his conjecture.\n\n\nHe tucked a strand of magic around his attacker's living file and flung it into the wall, and a circle appeared for a split second, and he dove through it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe old dryad stared at the school as it fell apart.\n\n\nHow had this happened?\n\n\nAbigail... Sweet little Abigail... Tore his soul out of his body, stripped him of magic, and bound him to watch the world waste away.\n\n\nHe'd been forced to watch as Bracken was sent back from the depths of Hades, and succeeded in his mission to kill Bellum Draco, one of the greatest men he had ever known.\n\n\nMagic without reason... He'd always thought it worse than the mundane... But now he was one.\n\n\nHe was Broken.\n\n\nHis school was destroyed.\n\n\nHis friends were killed.\n\n\nHis last and only student, Kyle Kilroy, was on a suicide mission to take on Death herself, and Abigail thought she fit the role.\n\n\nIt would be a fight for the ages... But he couldn't help feeling Kyle would give his soul willingly, just so that one day, Abigail might just find herself again.\n\n\nThere was no way out of this, not this time.\n\n\nThe Other Side had finally one.\n\n\nThe old orders were dying, and the new were not yet ready.\n\n\nNations like New Rome couldn't hope to understand the dangers of what were about to come crashing down on their heads.\n\n\nThere would be no more guardians against creatures like the vampires.\n\n\nMages would spontaneously find their power, and use it to destroy everything, just to try and get what they don't deserve.\n\n\nThe living would join the dead.\n\n\nDeath's empire would be complete.\n\n\nThere was no hope to be found, no sliver of solace.\n\n\nHis life's work had been a failure, and now he would be forced to watch it play out to the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nymph with black scales opened her eyes, springing to her feet.\n\n\nThe Clearing House may be empty, and endless, but magic had seen what her eyes had not.\n\n\nThere was a path from this place, to the next.\n\n\nTo the Palace, where her Court awaited her.\n\n\nWhere the traitor stood in her stead.\n\n\nHer memories in one hand, and her mortality in the other.\n\n\nShe clenched a fist, all her scales standing on end as the wind began to whistle around her in a circle.\n\n\nThe storm began to amp up, and static electricity began to jump among her scales as thunder boomed in the Void.\n\n\nShe opened her hand and it all froze, until she tossed her hand forward, like throwing a ball.\n\n\nThe Void distorted, a piece of itself spinning inside out, from four dimensions to sixteen.\n\n\nShe ignored her eyes and walked towards it, spinning it again, shifting it to align with the physical dimensions her body was limited to, and she passed through.\n\n\nShe was going home, scythe in hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandice ducked back from the ridge, glancing over at Kyle, his face set with a grim determination.\n\n\nShe shook her head, \"You're insane. There's got to be twenty thousand. Maybe more. They're Reapers. We'll die.\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, \"Girl, I've already died.\"\n\n\nCandice winced, \"Yeah... Not sure if Necromancy counts as living.\"\n\n\nKyle laughed, \"Can't argue with that... But I can do this, you don't need to be here.\"\n\n\nCandice rolled her eyes, \"You don't get it, do you? This is it, Kyle. There's nothing else. If I ran away, I'd have maybe a year to enjoy living. The dead are on the march. The Other Side is here to break everything, and kill everyone... And there's no one left to stop them. Run or don't run, it doesn't matter anymore... So I will be a Silvergate. I will fight.\"\n\n\nHe nodded slowly, a seriousness finally lighting in his eyes, and understanding of the stakes they were playing for.\n\n\nThe world was screwed.\n\n\nShe breathed deeply, hoping to hell that Kyle really could fix this all, and turned around, wanting another peep.\n\n\nA silver blade slashed the air, and the world vanished around her.\n\n\nShe was in a Void, as a scythe swung towards her.\n\n\nCandice seized the rage, the anger she'd been taught to cradle from a young age.\n\n\nThe injustice of a thousand years, forced from one generation to the next poured into her veins, and Abigail burst into flames, becoming the fire.\n\n\nShe punched forward blindly, seizing the scythe with all her strength.\n\n\nThe Reaper shook her off like a ragdoll, and the blade came crashing down again.",

In the midst of heated battle, dwarvish hammers against trollish clubs, he had found a sense of destiny.  In front of him, with gleaming axe, was the creature he loathed more than any other.  The dwarf launched himself towards him, and Little Slate clumsily blocked the blow, and punched down, dazing the dwarf.  \"Defiler-king!\" He spat, swinging his club around, but too slowly. The dwarf rolled under it, and leaped up, his axe lodging in Little Slate's shoulder.  He ignored the pain and kicked as hard as he could, sending the dwarf and his considerable.girth tumbling.  The man was instantly on his feet again, \"I am here to cleanse this.world of those akin to you, stupid, unhelpful and a stain on this world's history.\"  Little Slate didn't understand the words, but he knew an insult when he heard it.  He tore the axe free and threw it, hard.  The dwarf deftly danced out of the way, wobbling as he went, before launching a tiny steel bolt from his hand.  Little Slate yelled loudly as it went through one of his eyes, but he ignored it, grabbing his club with both hands and began to beat the ground where he thought the dwarf might be.  The man easily avoided his clumsy blows, before grabbing his axe and with a blow faster than Little Slate could realize, cut one of his hands off.  The club tumbled to the ground, and as it did, a dwarfish axe shattered his left leg. Not that he knew his left from his right.  Little Slate fell to the ground, the dwarvish leader of the Bloodbound Pact standing in front of him, \"Are you ready to die, troll?\"  Little Slate grinned and pushed himself, his whole bulk suddenly landing on top of the troll, his one hand came around, and grabbed the struggling dwarf's head.  He stopped struggling with a pop.  Little Slate rolled over, feeling the weak trying to overtake all in him.  Battle lost.  He dying.  But dwarf-king dead.  He sighed sadly, and closed his eyes.    The hard black stone that made up the ground cracked as Abigail's foot touched down.  She was home.  There was a pause as the vortex behind her fell apart, and the occupants of the Void looked at her, and she smiled softly.  They ran towards her.  This was the Clearing House, and she would clear it.  The scythe appeared in her hand, and she made an upwards cutting message. A swath of souls went down, shredded.  But there were more than enough to make things interesting for her.  She was Death, and they had died.  Their souls were hers.  She weaved deftly as a sword made of bone tried to tear, and it was more tear than cut, her throat.  Abigail toyed with the man, a dark elf, probably from before her memories as a ny.ph stretched back. She briefly wondered if she'd ever get her memories back.  There was a usurper to be punished.  Someone had done this to her.  The butt of her scythe hit the ground, the souls freezing in place.  She made a sweeping gesture, and the souls were torn apart, fading.  She was alone.    Bracken grinned as he ducked passed a falling stone and danced over some cracks in the floor.  He saw his target, as regal and sure as always, standing beside a circular crack, uttering some spell.  He laughed, \"I can send you after her, Bellum. Wouldn't take much.\"  The half-dragon spun around with surprising grace, considering the building was falling apart.  Bracken shrugged, \"Why did you leave me dead, Draco?\"  The man sneered, \"You were better off that way.\"  Bracken shook his head, \"I tried to keep Kyle occupied. I tried to tutor him, protect him. You let him die, and created the monster that has led to this moment.\"  Draco shrugged, \"A better monster than you.\"  Bracken drew and flicked his wand in a smooth motion, and Draco froze, rigid. The professor glared, \"This is the spell I died for, Headmaster. The impossible, illegal one... Wouldn't it be fitting if I just left you here, let the College kill you?\"  Bracken sighed heavily, \"But then again... You're a half dragon. You wouldn't be killed. You'd survive, and that fiery passion would ruin every chance I've been given at a second chance.\"  Before he had a chance to gloat some more he felt his spell snap, and a dragon-scaled hand rammed up against his throat with a crushing grip. Bracken flicked his wand, sending them both flying.  He hit the ground tumbling, and then the ground beneath him shifted.  The whole school building had turned into little more than a child's wood block house.  He pushed himself upward, solidifying the air and stood there.  Not for long.  Draco was opposite him, both wings unfurled, his veins glowing a deep red through his scales, and his eyes had turned black.  He'd finally let the dragon out.  Bracken roared, flicking his wrist, a spell half formed in the air. But it wasn't enough, and it wasn't soon enough. The half-dragon slammed into him, claws biting into his shoulders as Draco roared, flames engulfing him.  The Aimimancer struggled for a moment, feeling his own pulse, his own blood, and tried to unleash it. Force some distance between the dragon and himself.  His spells were shattered by the energy screaming out from the figure holding him.  If it weren't for the sheer rage of the dragon he'd be dead already, and if he failed there would be no coming back.  A spell he'd only ever read about, and never dared to try and conjure entered his mind.  It was destructive, and focused on a genetic trait, causing many thousands to die... But there was only one like Draco.  He cast it.  It took more power than he expected, nearly burning him out, the magic sapping all he had.  He fell onto the rickety floor, as two feet solidly hit in front of him.  Bracken stared up at the dragon, bleeding from head to toe.  His tail was poised in the air, and struck hard, piercing straight through Bracken's abdomen and out his back.  He laughed, his wand twirling as his own injuries began to vanish, but he held tight to the tail as the dragon seemed dazed for a moment.  \"Instinct can only get you so far, Bellum.\"  He stood tall, smiling, trying to forget it was chance alone that he hadn't died.  How the hell could a dragon take so much damage and keep standing? Even now, with what should have been death's doorway hanging over him, Draco seemed to be not much more than dizzy and surprised.  Bracken flicked his wrist, breaking the Headmaster's wand. That would have been annoying.  He held out his hand, blood pooling into a ball above it, and he looked up at the man who had always stood in his way. The man who had always threatened to destroy him, if he stepped a foot out of line. The man who had had the power to save him from the Clearing House, but had left him to die.  It was over now.  He knew how to kill a dragon.  Just use anything with overkill.  He had felt a yell rip un-bidden from his throat as he slammed the ball into Draco's chest, and it erupted outwards, a volcanic reaction.  He saw the school drifting below him, the pieces that had been the Headmaster scattered around the room, and he smiled.  Then he felt a twitch.  He looked down at the tail still embedded in his stomach, just in time for it to wrap around his throat and go taut.  As he began to fall, he knew it was too late.  Draco was a tough bastard.    The storm spun furiously above his head, as spells rained down.  Ilgun was focused, more than he had ever been in his long and varied career, and blocking out attackers whilst attempting something new was something of a specialty.  That being said, so far, he'd underestimated the power he'd needed almost a dozen times.  Kilroy had asserted that he'd need the potential energy from a universal collapse, but to be frank, it sounded ludicrous. Something short of that utter destruction should be possible.  It had to be.  A fireball broke through the barrier and hit the ground beside him with a puff of dirt and smoke.  That was a bad sign.  He just had to transport himself without touching Elvish soil. He'd already managed to convince his late Queen's spell that his house didn't really belong to the Kingdom. That had been easy. A little Aimimancy.  The minimum size of the portal had to be related to the energy required to generate it, not just the distance covered... Otherwise he'd have made the portal already... What was the math Kilroy had sketched out?  A boulder about ten times his body wait hit the ground and kept going.  Negative mass.  He'd assumed that magic could simply equate for that, cancel out the negative mass of the tunnel with a positive mass... But maybe not.  If it didn't cancel out, then you had to adjust the frequency of the fields employed until everything was positive, and physics would take over and create the negative... And rip open a tunnel that you could pass through.  Ilgun suddenly flung himself aside as his whole cloud turned into a churning fireball and hit the ground.  He swore loudly, no time to test his conjecture.  He tucked a strand of magic around his attacker's living file and flung it into the wall, and a circle appeared for a split second, and he dove through it.    The old dryad stared at the school as it fell apart.  How had this happened?  Abigail... Sweet little Abigail... Tore his soul out of his body, stripped him of magic, and bound him to watch the world waste away.  He'd been forced to watch as Bracken was sent back from the depths of Hades, and succeeded in his mission to kill Bellum Draco, one of the greatest men he had ever known.  Magic without reason... He'd always thought it worse than the mundane... But now he was one.  He was Broken.  His school was destroyed.  His friends were killed.  His last and only student, Kyle Kilroy, was on a suicide mission to take on Death herself, and Abigail thought she fit the role.  It would be a fight for the ages... But he couldn't help feeling Kyle would give his soul willingly, just so that one day, Abigail might just find herself again.  There was no way out of this, not this time.  The Other Side had finally one.  The old orders were dying, and the new were not yet ready.  Nations like New Rome couldn't hope to understand the dangers of what were about to come crashing down on their heads.  There would be no more guardians against creatures like the vampires.  Mages would spontaneously find their power, and use it to destroy everything, just to try and get what they don't deserve.  The living would join the dead.  Death's empire would be complete.  There was no hope to be found, no sliver of solace.  His life's work had been a failure, and now he would be forced to watch it play out to the end.    The nymph with black scales opened her eyes, springing to her feet.  The Clearing House may be empty, and endless, but magic had seen what her eyes had not.  There was a path from this place, to the next.  To the Palace, where her Court awaited her.  Where the traitor stood in her stead.  Her memories in one hand, and her mortality in the other.  She clenched a fist, all her scales standing on end as the wind began to whistle around her in a circle.  The storm began to amp up, and static electricity began to jump among her scales as thunder boomed in the Void.  She opened her hand and it all froze, until she tossed her hand forward, like throwing a ball.  The Void distorted, a piece of itself spinning inside out, from four dimensions to sixteen.  She ignored her eyes and walked towards it, spinning it again, shifting it to align with the physical dimensions her body was limited to, and she passed through.  She was going home, scythe in hand.    Candice ducked back from the ridge, glancing over at Kyle, his face set with a grim determination.  She shook her head, \"You're insane. There's got to be twenty thousand. Maybe more. They're Reapers. We'll die.\"  Kyle shrugged, \"Girl, I've already died.\"  Candice winced, \"Yeah... Not sure if Necromancy counts as living.\"  Kyle laughed, \"Can't argue with that... But I can do this, you don't need to be here.\"  Candice rolled her eyes, \"You don't get it, do you? This is it, Kyle. There's nothing else. If I ran away, I'd have maybe a year to enjoy living. The dead are on the march. The Other Side is here to break everything, and kill everyone... And there's no one left to stop them. Run or don't run, it doesn't matter anymore... So I will be a Silvergate. I will fight.\"  He nodded slowly, a seriousness finally lighting in his eyes, and understanding of the stakes they were playing for.  The world was screwed.  She breathed deeply, hoping to hell that Kyle really could fix this all, and turned around, wanting another peep.  A silver blade slashed the air, and the world vanished around her.  She was in a Void, as a scythe swung towards her.  Candice seized the rage, the anger she'd been taught to cradle from a young age.  The injustice of a thousand years, forced from one generation to the next poured into her veins, and Abigail burst into flames, becoming the fire.  She punched forward blindly, seizing the scythe with all her strength.  The Reaper shook her off like a ragdoll, and the blade came crashing down again.",

            "text": "Chapter Twenty\n\n\n\n\nThe old tyrant leaned up against the wall, feeling his spirit pulsing in the world above.\n\n\nHis hammer, dented by so many thousands of years, lay by his hip. His helmet hid his face, the narrow slit of the visor revealing only two jet black eyes, staring out from the shadows.\n\n\nBehind him were two doors made of stone, leading in to a palace.\n\n\nHe shifted his weight against them as a black-scaled nymph came into view, her scythe in hand.\n\n\nHe winced and shook his head, \"Go back, Abigail. This is not the time or the place.\"\n\n\nThe ground shook, and her grip tightened on her scythe, \"Who in the Shades do you think you are?\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"I am War. Who do you think you are?\"\n\n\nThe scythe swirled, and he heard her voice dimly ad the world fell away, \"I am Death!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrath glanced up, his insane head of her wobbling, as the doors opened.\n\n\nHe laughed as he saw the little nymph there, standing so tall and so proud.\n\n\n\"What is it that you want, little Ignis?\"\n\n\nShe roared, launching towards him. He sighed and spun a spell, throwing her face first into the black stone floor. \"I am not as kind as War. I fuelled his soldiers. I am the anger trying to burst of your chest, I am Wrath.\"\n\n\nShe pushed herself to her feet, and he shook his head, a ball of magic pancaking her into the floor, \"No, no, no. You don't get to stand. Not after what you've done. No.\"\n\n\nHe stood over her, glaring down, \"What are you Abigail? Your best friend dies, and you steal her boyfriend. Fiona cared about you. She was one of the few people you ever let close... You didn't even mourn her.\"\n\n\nShe yelled, breaking free of the spell, her scythe making a beeline for his face, but he swatted it aside like it was rubber.\n\n\n\"You don't know what you're talking about!\" She yelled, glaring at him, and he laughed, \"Don't I? I'm wrath. I'm your self-loathing. I'm the anger inside you, eating you alive.\"\n\n\nAbigail's knuckles turned white, \"I will.destroy you.\"\n\n\nWrath laughed and flicked his wrist, sending her flying into the wall. She hit it with a meaty thud before collapsing twitching onto the ground.\n\n\n\"I don't think so, Abigail... For that, you'd need to forgive yourself... And that's just not going to happen. You deserve this. You are nothing. Just a little bitch who likes to swim... Think about everything Kyle sacrificed for you... And you throw it in his face, coming storming in here... Thinking what, that an untrained little nymph is stronger than the most powerful Necromancer this world has ever known?\"\n\n\nA chink in her armor appeared, a flash of a wince. He was getting to her.\n\n\nWrath sneered, \"The nymph who couldn't make a golem... Tell me again, how many professors who followed you into battle made it out? How'd the Vitamancer protect them?\"\n\n\nAbigail pushed herself to her feet, and his fist came swinging around, punching her into the ground hard enough to chip the stone. \"Come now, little nymph, where's the flirting that had saved you, your whole life?\"\n\n\nTears formed in her eyes, \"I'm not like that.\"\n\n\n\"But you are,\" he spat on the ground, \"You are the worst of your kind.\"\n\n\n\"I am.\" She said, her voice suddenly firming.\n\n\nWrath barely had a chance to realize his mistake.\n\n\n\"I am Death.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSin smiled as she saw the bleeding nymph limping towards her, she laughed and swung the door open, bowing falsely, \"Your majesty.\"\n\n\nThe nymph roared, and it was a roar, and launched at her.\n\n\nSin glared, ducking the scythe before grabbing a delicate wrist, \"I tried to play nice.\"\n\n\nShe snapped it, and shoved Abigail backwards onto the ground. She glared down, \"You really need to learn some manners.\"\n\n\nShe stopped down, shattering the ribcage, separating the spine.\n\n\nShe turned and walked through the door, \"Seeya, Abigail.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudgement paused as he saw the bleeding man in front of him, and cocked his head, \"Kilroy?\"\n\n\nKyle smiled ruefully, \"Hey Judgement... Been a while... I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry. I need you to open these gates.\"\n\n\nThe old spirit sighed heavily, \"I'm sorry, Kyle. You're still not worthy. You haven't moved on.\"\n\n\nKyle winced, and spun his hand slowly, \"I did try and ask.\"\n\n\nJudgement cocked an eyebrow, \"Are you really picking a fight, Kyle?\"\n\n\nHe shrugged, \"I don't have a lot of choice.\"\n\n\nJudgement shook his head, \"You walked through an army of Reapers to get here... Close the portal. Your world will be safe, and you can walk away.\"\n\n\nKyle shook his head, \"That's not how this works. I have a debt to pay, and I will pay it.\"\n\n\nJudgement winced, \"The Lady is a tad bit occupied, for your sort of worries.\"\n\n\nKyle flicked his wrist, grabbing hold of the tendrils of magic that made up the physical world of the Other Side, \"I know. She asked me to come here. I have a debt, and its due.\"\n\n\nJudgement sighed and drew his sword, \"Okay, Kyle.\"\n\n\nThe necromancer yanked, the steel gates behind the spirit exploding into shrapnel, sending him stumbling.\n\n\nKyle twisted the ground and punched down, the spirit vanishing beneath the soil.\n\n\nHe backed away slowly, the gates were open, but Judgement wasn't dead, not by a long shot.\n\n\nThe ground behind him exploded as the spirit leapt into the air, sword curling around in a perfect arc.\n\n\nKyle dropped to the ground, feeling his hair tumble away, and then a fireball burst from his hands, knocking Judgement backwards.\n\n\nThe spirit shook his head, \"Kyle Kilroy, you have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting.\"\n\n\nKyle clenched, fueling his anger, and burst into flames. He ran forward, tackling the spirit.\n\n\nJudgement's flesh burned, releasing a scent that was disturbingly like roasted meat. But the spirit was far from done, and a single punch to his head sent Kyle rolling.\n\n\nHe sprang to his feet and saw the blade bearing down on him, and did the only thing he could think to do.\n\n\nHe caught it, and the blade bit deep into his hands.\n\n\nJudgement glared and began to push harder.\n\n\nKyle ignored the tug of war, and focused on his Pyromancy. Heat was the key to this battle, not strength.\n\n\nMolten metal began to drip onto the ground, as it scorched what was left of his hands.\n\n\nJudgement pulled away, tossing aside the remains of his sword and smiled, \"Lateral thinking can only get you so far, Kyle.\"\n\n\nHe tensed, but the spirit shrugged, \"It is not my place to block the way for the worthy. Go ahead.\"\n\n\nKyle's flames extinguished and he nearly collapsed, but he was caught by Judgement, who looked him in the eye, \"Feed him to the Shades, Kyle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe doors were tall, impossibly so. They were as tall as the Other Side, and represented the division between the dead, and those who ruled them.\n\n\nThe throne he sat in was incredibly uncomfortable, but he knew better than to change that - Death had bound the throne to the Other Side.\n\n\nIt was supposed to be some symbol about how a leader needed to be among their people, working, rather than presiding over them.\n\n\nPersonally, he thought it was stupid.\n\n\nHowever, those doors were opening.\n\n\nDiscord leaned.forward, and put a hand under his chin, \"What idiot seeks to enter chaos?\"\n\n\nThe doors flew open with a crash, leaving a half-dead human standing in front.of him.\n\n\nHe glared, \"Wait... Kilroy, wasn't it? The boy presumptuous enough to make a deal with Death?\"\n\n\nKyle shrugged, painfully, and spoke, \"I'm here to pay my debt to the Lady.\"\n\n\nDiscord.rolled his eyes, \"Death's dead, kid. I'm in charge now.\"\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\nThere was a lot of determination, anger and a small feeling of justice in that tone, but no respect.\n\n\nDiscord rolled his eyes, \"So what you going to do?\"\n\n\n\"I challenge you.\"\n\n\nDiscord burst out laughing, \"No thanks. Reapers?\"\n\n\nA thousand scythe bearing souls appeared behind the throne, \"Take this as a challenge, Kilroy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle swore as magic swirled around him. Reapers were masters, and the magic they channeled was the stuff of dreams, or nightmares in his case.\n\n\nHe could avoid their traps, turn their attacks inside out, but there was a fact he couldn't avoid.\n\n\nHe was worn out. He'd already taken on army of Reapers, had been forced to fight Judgement.\n\n\nNow he had another army to contend with, and hope he had enough strength left to distract Discord.\n\n\nThis was insanity.\n\n\nIf he died here, then he would become Discord's plaything. His necromancy would mean nothing.\n\n\nDiscord was its creator.\n\n\nBut for now, a thousand scythes tore into the moment of the universe where he was located, each one taking a piece of him with them.\n\n\nWhat had Judgement said?\n\n\nSomething about being found wanting?\n\n\nAnger was a tool had long since learned to use. His anger at himself, at the world, and at injustice.\n\n\nSomeone had taken the Other Side from the haven it should have been, and turned it into a place of torture.\n\n\nHe felt the magic swirling through him, and shaped it.\n\n\nA scythe split in half in front of him as a blade of wind was forged into existence. The face behind it fared worse.\n\n\nKyle bristled, spinning and casting.\n\n\nThese were innocent people, forced to serve at their master's hands, but Kyle knew a secret.\n\n\nThe scythe was their channel.\n\n\nWithout it, their magic was damn near useless against him.\n\n\nSo he took them from them.\n\n\nKyle felt onto one knee, bleeding from head to toe, and glared up at the throne, \"I challenge you, Discord.\"\n\n\nThe spirit stood up, stepping down slowly, \"You challenge me. Really.\"\n\n\nThere was no question there, just ridicule.\n\n\nKyle smiled pushing himself upright, \"Soul for soul.\"\n\n\nDiscord paused, \"Soul... For soul. I accept.\"\n\n\nThen Kyle was sent flying into the room, every bone in his back breaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world was swirling, and Abigail lay in bed, coughing violently, blood staining her sheets.\n\n\nBeside her was her mother stroking her forehead tenderly, smiling down at her.\n\n\nAbigail winced, \"I'm dying...\"\n\n\nHer mother nodded sadly, \"Yeah, sorry, princess... But it looks that way.\"\n\n\nShe winced, \"That's not fair.\"\n\n\nHer mother shrugged, \"Whatever. It's not like you've ever had an easy life, and this isn't one of those moments. Sometimes\u2026 You just don't get to take a break.\"\n\n\nAbigail looked at her in fear, \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\n\"I've got a promise to keep, and I love you, princess.\" Her mother sighed heavily and leaned in and kissed her forehead, \"Time to go back, sweetie.\"\n\n\nAbigail sat up, coughing violently, blood spraying from her mouth.\n\n\nShe breathed in and out heavily, eyes wide open as she stared around her.\n\n\nIt was stone.\n\n\nShe was in a building.\n\n\nA palace.\n\n\nThe Other Side.\n\n\nShe'd attacked Sin\u2026 And Sin had\u2026 Basically killed her.\n\n\nAbigail cringed, and then noticed the prone figure lying beside her, one hand on her leg.\n\n\nThey were a nymph, but their scales were jet black, tinged with red. They were relatively tall, and a broken scythe lay beside them.\n\n\nAbigail smiled sadly, tears welling in her eyes.\n\n\nThey looked almost exactly like her, except for the hair, which had faded from white to grey. They were old, but the resemblance was impossible to ignore.\n\n\nAbigail had never known her mother, she'd been an orphan.\n\n\nDeath was her mother.\n\n\nShe wasn't Death, she had her memories.\n\n\nShe was a nymph, proficient with Vitamancy, adept at Messormancy, Daughter of Death and angry as all the Shades combined.\n\n\nAbigail lurched to her feet, wincing as she felt the cut that made up half her side crack open again, and blood begin to run down it.\n\n\nHer mother had given her life for her, and she wasn't going to waste it.\n\n\nSomeone was in charge of the Other Side, and they were messing it up.\n\n\nA scythe appeared in her hand, and she kicked open the giant wooden doors, taller than she could see.\n\n\nHer heart leapt as she saw Kyle, and then she saw the man with black dreadlocks beating him to death as slowly as he could.\n\n\nAnger moved through her, and she grabbed the fabric of reality, shifting it.\n\n\nAs she appeared beside the man, she spotted Sin leaning idly against a wall, yawning.\n\n\nAbigail grabbed the man from behind and ripped her scythe through him, Breaking him.\n\n\nThe magic vanished.\n\n\nThe man spun around in shock, \"You little-\"\n\n\nHis head turned into shrapnel, and Abigail stared through the mess, spotting Kyle standing weakly on his feet, his hand clenched.\n\n\nAbigail heard a wail, and glanced over at Sin, one hand over her mouth in shock, and then the spirit attacked.\n\n\nA ball of magic, made up of something Abigail had never seen before shot across the room towards her, intended for her.\n\n\nBut Kyle was still standing in front of her.\n\n\nHe dropped to the ground, the pupils disappearing from his eyes.\n\n\nKyle was gone.\n\n\nThe stress of the past, the grief of losing her mother, and now Kyle\u2026 The anger that had been building since the Reaper in her had appeared\u2026 It all came to the surface.\n\n\n\"Et claustra arguisset nunc anima oblinire tunc peccatum!\" Abigail roared and pointed the scythe, and the blonde bombshell screamed as she vanished, her soul obliterated.\n\n\nThe scythe vanished as Abigail's scales faded to blue and she dropped to her knees, grabbing Kyle.\n\n\nShe cradled his head, \"Stay with me, please\u2026\"\n\n\nHis head lay like a dead weight in her hands, and he glanced up at her, his eyes sightless and nearly shut, \"So\u2026rry\u2026\"\n\n\nAbigail bit her lip, tears flowing down her cheeks, as she saw images flash before her.\n\n\nKyle and Death, making a deal.\n\n\nA hope, a plan to take Discord down.\n\n\nDeath had no soul, but Kyle did.\n\n\nHe gave it away\u2026 So Death could give it to Abigail\u2026 Even though she'd die in the act.\n\n\nThey both died.\n\n\nSo she'd have a chance.\n\n\nIt wasn't fair.\n\n\nTears streamed down her face and she held Kyle's lifeless body.\n\n\nThey should have had a chance, together.\n\n\nSome sort of hope.\n\n\n\u2026 At least a second kiss\u2026\n\n\nA life\u2026\n\n\nBut instead, Kyle was dead\u2026 And she was left, alone, in the Other Side.",

You didn't even mourn her.\"  She yelled, breaking free of the spell, her scythe making a beeline for his face, but he swatted it aside like it was rubber.  \"You don't know what you're talking about!\" She yelled, glaring at him, and he laughed, \"Don't I? I'm wrath. I'm your self-loathing. I'm the anger inside you, eating you alive.\"  Abigail's knuckles turned white, \"I will.destroy you.\"  Wrath laughed and flicked his wrist, sending her flying into the wall. She hit it with a meaty thud before collapsing twitching onto the ground.  \"I don't think so, Abigail... For that, you'd need to forgive yourself... And that's just not going to happen. You deserve this. You are nothing. Just a little bitch who likes to swim... Think about everything Kyle sacrificed for you... And you throw it in his face, coming storming in here... Thinking what, that an untrained little nymph is stronger than the most powerful Necromancer this world has ever known?\"  A chink in her armor appeared, a flash of a wince. He was getting to her.  Wrath sneered, \"The nymph who couldn't make a golem... Tell me again, how many professors who followed you into battle made it out? How'd the Vitamancer protect them?\"  Abigail pushed herself to her feet, and his fist came swinging around, punching her into the ground hard enough to chip the stone. \"Come now, little nymph, where's the flirting that had saved you, your whole life?\"  Tears formed in her eyes, \"I'm not like that.\"  \"But you are,\" he spat on the ground, \"You are the worst of your kind.\"  \"I am.\" She said, her voice suddenly firming.  Wrath barely had a chance to realize his mistake.  \"I am Death.\"    Sin smiled as she saw the bleeding nymph limping towards her, she laughed and swung the door open, bowing falsely, \"Your majesty.\"  The nymph roared, and it was a roar, and launched at her.  Sin glared, ducking the scythe before grabbing a delicate wrist, \"I tried to play nice.\"  She snapped it, and shoved Abigail backwards onto the ground. She glared down, \"You really need to learn some manners.\"  She stopped down, shattering the ribcage, separating the spine.  She turned and walked through the door, \"Seeya, Abigail.\"    Judgement paused as he saw the bleeding man in front of him, and cocked his head, \"Kilroy?\"  Kyle smiled ruefully, \"Hey Judgement... Been a while... I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry. I need you to open these gates.\"  The old spirit sighed heavily, \"I'm sorry, Kyle. You're still not worthy. You haven't moved on.\"  Kyle winced, and spun his hand slowly, \"I did try and ask.\"  Judgement cocked an eyebrow, \"Are you really picking a fight, Kyle?\"  He shrugged, \"I don't have a lot of choice.\"  Judgement shook his head, \"You walked through an army of Reapers to get here... Close the portal. Your world will be safe, and you can walk away.\"  Kyle shook his head, \"That's not how this works. I have a debt to pay, and I will pay it.\"  Judgement winced, \"The Lady is a tad bit occupied, for your sort of worries.\"  Kyle flicked his wrist, grabbing hold of the tendrils of magic that made up the physical world of the Other Side, \"I know. She asked me to come here. I have a debt, and its due.\"  Judgement sighed and drew his sword, \"Okay, Kyle.\"  The necromancer yanked, the steel gates behind the spirit exploding into shrapnel, sending him stumbling.  Kyle twisted the ground and punched down, the spirit vanishing beneath the soil.  He backed away slowly, the gates were open, but Judgement wasn't dead, not by a long shot.  The ground behind him exploded as the spirit leapt into the air, sword curling around in a perfect arc.  Kyle dropped to the ground, feeling his hair tumble away, and then a fireball burst from his hands, knocking Judgement backwards.  The spirit shook his head, \"Kyle Kilroy, you have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting.\"  Kyle clenched, fueling his anger, and burst into flames. He ran forward, tackling the spirit.  Judgement's flesh burned, releasing a scent that was disturbingly like roasted meat. But the spirit was far from done, and a single punch to his head sent Kyle rolling.  He sprang to his feet and saw the blade bearing down on him, and did the only thing he could think to do.  He caught it, and the blade bit deep into his hands.  Judgement glared and began to push harder.  Kyle ignored the tug of war, and focused on his Pyromancy. Heat was the key to this battle, not strength.  Molten metal began to drip onto the ground, as it scorched what was left of his hands.  Judgement pulled away, tossing aside the remains of his sword and smiled, \"Lateral thinking can only get you so far, Kyle.\"  He tensed, but the spirit shrugged, \"It is not my place to block the way for the worthy. Go ahead.\"  Kyle's flames extinguished and he nearly collapsed, but he was caught by Judgement, who looked him in the eye, \"Feed him to the Shades, Kyle.\"    The doors were tall, impossibly so. They were as tall as the Other Side, and represented the division between the dead, and those who ruled them.  The throne he sat in was incredibly uncomfortable, but he knew better than to change that - Death had bound the throne to the Other Side.  It was supposed to be some symbol about how a leader needed to be among their people, working, rather than presiding over them.  Personally, he thought it was stupid.  However, those doors were opening.  Discord leaned.forward, and put a hand under his chin, \"What idiot seeks to enter chaos?\"  The doors flew open with a crash, leaving a half-dead human standing in front.of him.  He glared, \"Wait... Kilroy, wasn't it? The boy presumptuous enough to make a deal with Death?\"  Kyle shrugged, painfully, and spoke, \"I'm here to pay my debt to the Lady.\"  Discord.rolled his eyes, \"Death's dead, kid. I'm in charge now.\"  \"I know.\"  There was a lot of determination, anger and a small feeling of justice in that tone, but no respect.  Discord rolled his eyes, \"So what you going to do?\"  \"I challenge you.\"  Discord burst out laughing, \"No thanks. Reapers?\"  A thousand scythe bearing souls appeared behind the throne, \"Take this as a challenge, Kilroy.\"    Kyle swore as magic swirled around him. Reapers were masters, and the magic they channeled was the stuff of dreams, or nightmares in his case.  He could avoid their traps, turn their attacks inside out, but there was a fact he couldn't avoid.  He was worn out. He'd already taken on army of Reapers, had been forced to fight Judgement.  Now he had another army to contend with, and hope he had enough strength left to distract Discord.  This was insanity.  If he died here, then he would become Discord's plaything. His necromancy would mean nothing.  Discord was its creator.  But for now, a thousand scythes tore into the moment of the universe where he was located, each one taking a piece of him with them.  What had Judgement said?  Something about being found wanting?  Anger was a tool had long since learned to use. His anger at himself, at the world, and at injustice.  Someone had taken the Other Side from the haven it should have been, and turned it into a place of torture.  He felt the magic swirling through him, and shaped it.  A scythe split in half in front of him as a blade of wind was forged into existence. The face behind it fared worse.  Kyle bristled, spinning and casting.  These were innocent people, forced to serve at their master's hands, but Kyle knew a secret.  The scythe was their channel.  Without it, their magic was damn near useless against him.  So he took them from them.  Kyle felt onto one knee, bleeding from head to toe, and glared up at the throne, \"I challenge you, Discord.\"  The spirit stood up, stepping down slowly, \"You challenge me. Really.\"  There was no question there, just ridicule.  Kyle smiled pushing himself upright, \"Soul for soul.\"  Discord paused, \"Soul... For soul. I accept.\"  Then Kyle was sent flying into the room, every bone in his back breaking.    The world was swirling, and Abigail lay in bed, coughing violently, blood staining her sheets.  Beside her was her mother stroking her forehead tenderly, smiling down at her.  Abigail winced, \"I'm dying...\"  Her mother nodded sadly, \"Yeah, sorry, princess... But it looks that way.\"  She winced, \"That's not fair.\"  Her mother shrugged, \"Whatever. It's not like you've ever had an easy life, and this isn't one of those moments. Sometimes\u2026 You just don't get to take a break.\"  Abigail looked at her in fear, \"What does that mean?\"  \"I've got a promise to keep, and I love you, princess.\" Her mother sighed heavily and leaned in and kissed her forehead, \"Time to go back, sweetie.\"  Abigail sat up, coughing violently, blood spraying from her mouth.  She breathed in and out heavily, eyes wide open as she stared around her.  It was stone.  She was in a building.  A palace.  The Other Side.  She'd attacked Sin\u2026 And Sin had\u2026 Basically killed her.  Abigail cringed, and then noticed the prone figure lying beside her, one hand on her leg.  They were a nymph, but their scales were jet black, tinged with red. They were relatively tall, and a broken scythe lay beside them.  Abigail smiled sadly, tears welling in her eyes.  They looked almost exactly like her, except for the hair, which had faded from white to grey. They were old, but the resemblance was impossible to ignore.  Abigail had never known her mother, she'd been an orphan.  Death was her mother.  She wasn't Death, she had her memories.  She was a nymph, proficient with Vitamancy, adept at Messormancy, Daughter of Death and angry as all the Shades combined.  Abigail lurched to her feet, wincing as she felt the cut that made up half her side crack open again, and blood begin to run down it.  Her mother had given her life for her, and she wasn't going to waste it.  Someone was in charge of the Other Side, and they were messing it up.  A scythe appeared in her hand, and she kicked open the giant wooden doors, taller than she could see.  Her heart leapt as she saw Kyle, and then she saw the man with black dreadlocks beating him to death as slowly as he could.  Anger moved through her, and she grabbed the fabric of reality, shifting it.  As she appeared beside the man, she spotted Sin leaning idly against a wall, yawning.  Abigail grabbed the man from behind and ripped her scythe through him, Breaking him.  The magic vanished.  The man spun around in shock, \"You little-\"  His head turned into shrapnel, and Abigail stared through the mess, spotting Kyle standing weakly on his feet, his hand clenched.  Abigail heard a wail, and glanced over at Sin, one hand over her mouth in shock, and then the spirit attacked.  A ball of magic, made up of something Abigail had never seen before shot across the room towards her, intended for her.  But Kyle was still standing in front of her.  He dropped to the ground, the pupils disappearing from his eyes.  Kyle was gone.  The stress of the past, the grief of losing her mother, and now Kyle\u2026 The anger that had been building since the Reaper in her had appeared\u2026 It all came to the surface.  \"Et claustra arguisset nunc anima oblinire tunc peccatum!\" Abigail roared and pointed the scythe, and the blonde bombshell screamed as she vanished, her soul obliterated.  The scythe vanished as Abigail's scales faded to blue and she dropped to her knees, grabbing Kyle.  She cradled his head, \"Stay with me, please\u2026\"  His head lay like a dead weight in her hands, and he glanced up at her, his eyes sightless and nearly shut, \"So\u2026rry\u2026\"  Abigail bit her lip, tears flowing down her cheeks, as she saw images flash before her.  Kyle and Death, making a deal.  A hope, a plan to take Discord down.  Death had no soul, but Kyle did.  He gave it away\u2026 So Death could give it to Abigail\u2026 Even though she'd die in the act.  They both died.  So she'd have a chance.  It wasn't fair.  Tears streamed down her face and she held Kyle's lifeless body.  They should have had a chance, together.  Some sort of hope.  \u2026 At least a second kiss\u2026  A life\u2026  But instead, Kyle was dead\u2026 And she was left, alone, in the Other Side.",
