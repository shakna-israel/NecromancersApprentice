# Principles of Magic

I, Adrian Duke, as a master of Vitamancy, authenticated by the School of Magic and History, present my findings on the workings of magic.

I have studied Vitamancy, one of the schools of magic, for most of my life.

One of the key aspects of Vitamancy, is that the school of magic that seems to complement it, is known as Necromancy, and yet, no known necromancers exist.

# Schools of Magic

The majority of theories say that magic is seemingly split into various segments.

A magic-wielder, a mage, has a latent skill with one or another of these magical segments, which have come to be known as schools.

I wish to present an alternative theory.

Currently, it is taught across our world that varying magic can be deployed, depending on the school of the mage. The mage's magic is defined by their school. What they can do is limited by their school.

From my own studies, I believe this to be false.

*Experiment 1*

Eight mages from each of the eight schools, were selected at random.

64 mages participated, unknowingly.

Each mage was privately tutored in the spells, but not the methods, associated with the school that is thought to pair with their own.

8 Pyromancers were taught basic aquamancy spells such as generating rain, using water to form useable objects, and breathing underwater. They were then assessed using standard school examinations.

8 Aquamancers were taught basic pyromancy spells such as generating flames, using fire to form useable objects, and preventing damage from heat. They were then assessed using standard school examinations.

8 Ventusamancers were taught basic terramancy spells such as manipulating stone, using levitating stone, and preventing damage from impact. They were then assessed using standard school examinations.

8 Terramancers were taught basic ventusamancy spells such as manipulating air, creating wind, and preventing damage from high winds. They were then assessed using standard school examinations.

8 Sanamancers were taught basic aimiamancy spells such as channeling power from blood, tying life forces together, and transferring damage. They were then assessed using standard school examinations.

8 Aimimancers were taught basic sanamancy spells such as channeling power from the living, unbinding spells, and removal of damage. They were then assessed using standard school examinations.

8 Vitamancers were taught basic necromancy spells such as speaking with the dead, stepping into the Other Side, and preventing death. They were then assessed using standard school examinations.

8 students of Necromancy were taught basic vitamancy spells such as seeing auras, future-telling, and embodying inanimate objects with life. They were then assessed usingstandard school examinations.

*Analysis*

1/8 Mages were unable to complete the task.

4/8 Mages were only able to marginally perform the task.

2/8 Mages were able to excel at the task.

Conclusion: Pyromancers are equally able to perform a simple aquamancy spell - but at greater difficulty.

*Analysis*

*Note:* Where a fail is designated, a fatality occured within this examination. As such, continued unbiased results were unable to be obtained, hence the study of only three basic spells.

4/8 Mages were unable to complete the task.

3/8 Mages were only able to marginally perform the task.

0/8 Mages were able to excel at the task.

Conclusion: Though Pyromancers apear equally able to perform simple aquamancy spells, at greater difficulty, when their life is put at risk, they return to their more natural channel of magic.
