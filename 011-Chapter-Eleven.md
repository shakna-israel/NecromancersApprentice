## Chapter Eleven
Abigail stared as she emerged from the water.

A troll towered over her, staring at the sun, but it was frozen, and it seemed basically dead.

Beneath it, a dryad was muttering, his hands passing over its body, and she shook her head, "I guess they couldn't kill you, either?"

Professor Duke smiled softly at her, turning, "Ah, Miss Ignis. I am glad to see you have survived this chaos."

She nodded towards the troll, "You do this?"

"Kyle." Duke said darkly and shook his head, "He's cursed the species. They turn to stone and lose their life when exposed to the sun… I could undo it… It's an evil act… But he surely has a reason."

Abigail frowned, "Kyle became a Necromancer really quickly, didn't he?"

Duke nodded, "Yes and no. One of the first things I learned, after I died, was that truly is relative, like the laws of physics tell us. And magic can manipulate that. Kyle used that to return, attempting to avert the disaster that has just happened."

Abigail smiled, "And you? What did you try and do?"

The dryad looked down sadly, "I attempted to change the past. I found I could not. Once something has been observed, the outcome is determined. I could not change that observation."

The nymph smiled softly, "So what now, professor?"

Duke looked up, staring at the school, "Somehow, I must counsel Kyle. Teach him."

Abigail blinked, "Wait… Isn't he… Stronger than you?"

"No." Duke said, shaking his head, "Just less restrained. He has yet to understand how dangerous his discovery is to those he cares about."

She sighed heavily, "Yay. Things are going to get worse, aren't they?"

The dryad creaked as he shrugged, "Perhaps. But for now, let us get you to safety."

Abigail nodded, "Yep. Sounds awesome… Where the hell would be safe?"

The professor shrugged as they began to walk, "To be honest… Nowhere is safe until Kyle has learned a semblance of restraint."
